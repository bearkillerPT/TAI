The text in the majority of these files has not been cleaned (files
with a script code like -latn or -cyrl in their names have been at
least partially cleaned).  It is included for completeness, but the
amount of text per language is extremely small and will definitely not
be enough to generate language models.  The files should be considered
samples to get a flavor of the language.
