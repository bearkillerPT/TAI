The files in this directory are omitted from use by default, because
the languages they contain are so similar to other languages that
they are identified as that other language more often than as the
correct language.

The file for Mauwake (mhl) contains Bible text which is
letter-for-letter identical to that for Mape (mlh), even though the
copr.txt files in the two archives clearly specify the respective
languages.  The PNG.bible site has the same two identical files, but
external evidence there lends some support to the hypothesis that the
correct language is Mape, so Mauwake has been demoted to Disabled
status.
