eng	First of all, a long time ago, God made everything. He made everything that is in the sky, and he made everything that is on the earth. God made all the things that are everywhere.
eng	God put the man into the garden and gave him a job. He had to look after the garden and make sure all the plants grew strong and healthy.
eng	If you try to grow plants in the ground nothing will grow for you. You will go away from me. And you will walk around in lots of places, but you will have no home.”
eng	He called his son Noah. Lamech said, “God cursed the ground. We have to work hard to dig the ground, but Noah will help us to be happy, even though we have to work hard.”
eng	After that, God said to Noah, “You are the only man that lives the right way. Get your family and take them into the big boat.
eng	Then, 6 weeks later, Noah opened the window in the top of the big boat. He wanted to find out if the water went down, and if a bird could find some dry ground.
eng	And I promise this to all the animals that live on the earth, too, all the birds, and all the quiet animals, and all the wild animals. I promise this to all of the animals that came out of the big
eng	The people that came from Ham split up into different tribes. Each one had their own language, and their own land. Ham’s sons were Cush, and Egypt, and Put, and Canaan.
eng	Those were all the families, and tribes, and nations that came from Shem. Each one had their own country and their own language.
eng	So John baptised Jesus, and as Jesus came up out of the water the sky opened up, and Jesus saw the spirit of God coming down like a pigeon, and landing on him.
eng	But now I’m telling you this, husbands and wives have to stay married to each other. Only if a man’s wife sleeps with another man, as if he is her husband, only then can her proper husband
eng	divorce her. But if a wife never does that, her husband can’t divorce her. If he divorces her, he is forcing her to go and sleep with another man, and that is wrong. And if another man marries her,
eng	And don’t worry about how long you will live, or when you will die. No matter how much you worry about it you will not live any longer, not even one day longer.
eng	So, to find out if a person is good or bad, look at what they do. A good person does good things. And a bad person does bad things.”
eng	There was another man that was already a follower of Jesus. He said to Jesus, “Sir, I will come with you. But my father has died, so let me go home to bury him. After that, I will come with you.”
eng	30-31 Well, you are more important to God than a big mob of those birds, so don’t be frightened. He knows you properly. He even knows how many hairs you have on your head. So he will only let
eng	Then Jesus said, “John the Baptiser is a very important man. He is greater than any other man that ever lived. But everyone in God’s family is more important than John the Baptiser.
eng	Jesus and his followers went and stayed in the town called Capernaum. There were some men that worked in God’s ceremony house. Every year they collected the tax money that all the Jewish people had
eng	to pay to look after God’s ceremony house. Those men went to Peter and asked him, “Is your teacher going to pay the tax money for God’s ceremony house?”
eng	Then the big boss got the worker to come in, and said to him, ‘You are really bad. You asked me to forget about all my money that you borrowed. It was millions of dollars. And I was good to you. I
eng	Jesus talked to the Jewish leaders. He said, “Tell me what you think about this picture story. A man had 2 sons. He went to the oldest son and said, ‘Son, go and work on our farm today.’
eng	So those 5 stupid ladies went to buy some oil. While they were away, that man came to the house to get married. The 5 other ladies were ready, and they went with him into the house, and somebody
eng	So we want to stop his followers, so that they can’t come and steal his body, and then tell everyone he got up alive again. If they do that, we’ll be worse off than before. So we want somebody to
eng	2-3 A long time before Jesus was born, God told a man called Isaiah to write about the things God was going to do for Jesus some time later. Isaiah wrote,
eng	Like before, Jesus called out to James and John to stop their work and follow him. Straight away they left their father and the other workmen in the boat, and they followed Jesus.
eng	But the man didn’t do what Jesus said. He went away and told everyone, “Jesus made me better.” After people heard the man’s story they came from everywhere. Lots of people came to Jesus. He
eng	couldn’t walk by himself in the towns any more. There were too many people. So he had to stay out in the bush. But people still came from everywhere and found him.
eng	The Jewish law men saw Jesus’s followers eating those seeds, and those law men got upset. They growled at Jesus and said, “Your mob are doing the wrong thing. Our Jewish law says that today is
eng	26-29 Jesus kept on teaching, and said, “I want you to know the way God’s family grows. This is another picture story. A man wanted to grow some seed food, so he threw some seeds on the ground.
eng	The seeds fell on the ground and after that the man walked away and left the seeds there. Those seeds grew all by themselves and that man didn’t know what made those seeds grow. He just left them
eng	there for many days and they grew. God made those seeds grow in the ground. At first the long stick part grew, and after that the head part grew with all the seeds inside it. At the right time God
eng	made the seeds get hard, ready for people to cut down those plants and pick up the seed food. God is boss for everyone and his family will grow just like the seeds in that story.”
eng	Then Jesus told the people, “Stay away from this man’s house.” He only let a few people go with him. They were the girl’s father and mother, and Peter, and James and his young brother John.
eng	25-26 There was a Greek woman there. She came from a place called Phoenicia in Syria. Her daughter had a bad spirit inside her. So that woman went to Jesus to get help. She got down on her knees in
eng	Jesus was a little bit upset. He breathed deeply and said, “You mob that are alive today always want to see something powerful before you will believe that God sent me. Listen, I’m telling you
eng	Jesus looked at the other followers there, then he said strongly to Peter, “Go away from me. You are like Satan. You are not thinking God’s way. You are just thinking like a man.”
eng	Jesus also said to them, “God will let you have a little bit of trouble. He wants to test you to see if you are walking straight for Him.”
eng	So Jesus called them all together and said, “You know what government people are like here in this world. They like to be bosses over everybody. It is like that everywhere in this world, the
eng	12-13 The next morning Jesus and his followers started to walk from Bethany back to Jerusalem. Jesus saw a tree not far away. It was the kind of tree that gets fruit called figs. Jesus was hungry, so
eng	he went to look for some figs on that tree, but there was nothing. It had lots of leaves but no fruit. (It wasn’t the right time of the year yet for fruit.)
eng	Then Jesus sat down near the money box at God’s house. He watched the people put money in the box to give it to God. Some rich people put in a lot of money
eng	There will be a lot of people that will tell lies and say they are the special man from God called Christ, but they will be trying to trick you. Other people will tell lies and say they are talking
eng	God’s words, and they might do all kinds of clever things. These people will be thinking, ‘Maybe we can trick the people that God picked out for himself.’ But really, they can’t do that.
eng	They heard him say this and they were very happy. They promised to pay him money. So Judas kept thinking about this and waited for the right time to help them catch Jesus.
eng	Jesus and His followers came to the place called Gethsemane. He said to them, “I want you to sit here and wait for me. I’m going to pray to God.”
eng	They said, “We heard this man say, ‘I will knock down God’s house and build another one in 3 days. Lots of men built this one, but I will build the new one just by myself.’”
eng	9-11 Pilate knew that the leaders of the Jewish ceremonies were jealous of Jesus and that was why they brought him to Pilate. They wanted Pilate to kill him. So when those Jerusalem people asked
eng	Pilate to let one prisoner go, he said, “All right. How about I let Jesus go, this man you say is your big boss. What do you reckon?”
eng	Some of the people standing around heard the words that Jesus said. They thought that he called out for Elijah to come to him from heaven.
eng	But the people in that community said, “No. He is going to Jerusalem. We don’t like that Jerusalem mob, so he is not our friend. He can’t camp here tonight.”
eng	Some of you are fathers. If your kid asks you for a fish to eat, will you give him a cheeky snake instead? No, of course not.
eng	Then he said to the people, “Think carefully about this. Don’t be greedy. Don’t try to get more things than you need. You can’t get a long happy life from the things you own, even if you are
eng	There’s no way they can pay you for that feed. But God will make you real happy. On the day when God will make everyone alive again, at that time he will pay you properly for that good thing you
eng	After he gets home he will call out to all his friends. He will say, ‘Hey, I’ve found my lost sheep. We can all be happy together now.’
eng	The worker said, ‘Your brother just came back home, and your dad is having a party for him. We just killed a young bullock and cooked its meat. Your brother is alive and well, so your dad is really
eng	But first, before that happens, the people that are alive today will reckon they don’t want me to be their boss, and they will hurt me a lot.
eng	I’m telling now, God listened to that bad man that was sorry, and God said he is all right. He went home feeling good. But God didn’t say that for the Pharisee, the man that reckoned he was real
eng	Herod was very happy to see Jesus. You see, a long time before that day Herod heard about Jesus, so he always wanted to meet him. He wanted to see Jesus do something powerful.
eng	9-11 Some of us were born Jews and some of us became Jews later. We are from a lot of different countries, and we can hear them talking the languages of these countries. Some of us are from Parthia,
eng	and some from Media, and some from Elam, and some from Mesopotamia, and some from Judea, and some from Cappadocia, and some from Pontus, and some from Asia, and some from Phrygia, and some from
eng	Pamphylia, and some from Egypt, and some from places in Libya near Cyrene, and some of us are from Crete, and some of us are from Arabia, and some of us are visiting from Rome. But all of us can hear
eng	But Peter and John said to those leaders, “Do you think that God wants us to listen to you? Or do you think he wants us to listen to him, and do the things he says? What do you reckon? We know he
eng	As soon as Ananias heard Peter say that he fell down and died. A lot of people heard about what happened and they were frightened.
eng	The soldiers brought the close followers of Jesus to the Jewish council men to talk to them. Then the big boss of the Jewish ceremonies growled at them and said,
eng	God helped Stephen to be good to everybody, and he gave Stephen the power to do great things to show people that God was great.
eng	That big boss tricked our family and was very hard on them. He made our mob throw their baby boys into the river to kill them.
eng	So then they made a statue that looked like a baby cow. They brought money and things to it, and they had a big party to show respect to the thing they made.
eng	Those men kept hitting Stephen with big stones. Then he called out, “Jesus, my leader, let my spirit come to be with you now.”
eng	Philip saw him sitting in his wagon and he was reading God’s book. He was reading the part that God’s man, called Isaiah, wrote a long time ago.
eng	There were some Jewish people in Jerusalem that talked the Greek language. Saul told them to believe in Jesus, but they argued with him. Then they got upset and tried to kill him.
eng	He started feeling hungry and he wanted something to eat, but he waited and prayed while the people in the house were getting some food ready. Then Peter had like a dream, but he was still awake.
eng	So right away I sent those men to bring you here. Thank you for coming. God can see us all here. We are ready to hear everything that he told you to say to us.”
eng	The Jewish leaders told Herod that they were happy for him to kill James, so Herod told his soldiers to grab Peter too. They grabbed him at the time for the Jewish people to have their ceremony where
eng	There were some good Christians in the church in the town called Antioch. They were men that told God’s messages and taught God’s word to people. They were Barnabas, and Simeon (his other name
eng	Listen, friends. Some of you are Jews that belong to our grand-father Abraham’s family, and some of you are not Jews but you respect our God. All of you listen to this message that God sent to us.
eng	So you people be careful. Don’t be like those people that God’s men wrote about.” That is the message that Paul told the people in that meeting in Antioch.
eng	But somebody told Paul and Barnabas what they wanted to do, and then Paul and Barnabas tore their clothes to show them they were upset, and they ran into the crowd of people. They shouted,
eng	He did the same thing for them that he did for us. They believed in him and he made them clean from the wrong things they did.
eng	Paul kept going, and he came to the towns called Derbe and Lystra. A Christian man called Timothy lived there. Timothy’s mother was a Jew and she believed in Jesus too, but Timothy’s father was a
eng	Later, in the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were praying aloud to God and saying that he is really good, and they were singing songs to God. The other prisoners were listening to them.
eng	The Jews that lived in Berea were happy to listen to the message about Jesus and they thought about it carefully, not like the Jews in Thessalonica. The Berea people read God’s book every day to

eng	And you know that I told you all of God’s message, everything that will help you. I didn’t keep anything secret. I taught you God’s message in places where everyone heard me, and I taught you
eng	We left Tyre on that ship and went to a town called Ptolemais. There were Christians in that town too, so we went and said hello to them, and we stayed with them that night.
eng	The light was so bright that I fell down to the ground. Then I heard the voice of somebody talking to me from the sky. He said, ‘Saul. Saul. Why are you making trouble for me and hurting me?’
eng	Don’t do what they will ask you to do. There are more than 40 men that will hide beside that road and wait for Paul to come along, so they can grab him and kill him. They even promised God that
eng	they will not eat or drink anything until they kill Paul. They are ready right now. They are just waiting for you to agree to do what they want.”
eng	Then they asked Festus, “Can you tell your soldiers to bring Paul to Jerusalem right now, and judge him here?” You see, they were going to secretly hide near the road and wait for Paul to come
eng	So I asked them, ‘What did he do?’ And I found out that he didn’t do anything bad, so we can’t kill him. But then he asked me to send him to Rome, for our biggest boss to judge him, so now I

eng	After Paul was in Rome for 3 days, he sent a message to the Jewish leaders to come and talk with him. So they came, and Paul said to them, “My brothers, I didn’t do anything bad to our people,
eng	and I didn’t say anything bad about our Jewish culture. But our leaders in Jerusalem grabbed me, and they started to kill me. Then the boss of the Roman soldiers came and got me, and made me his
eng	He taught them the way that God takes people into his family, and he taught them all about our leader Jesus Christ. He wasn’t frightened of anyone, and nobody tried to stop him talking to people.
eng	They didn’t want the wonderful God that never dies, but instead they made models of things that do die. They made things that look like people, or birds, or animals, or snakes or those kinds of
eng	It is like this. We believe in Jesus, so God tells us, “You are all right now.” But if we only think about that law and try to do the things it says, God will not tell us that we are all right.
eng	And that’s not all. Jesus Christ bled and died for us, so now God tells us, “You are all right,” and there is no way that he will get angry with us or punish us.
eng	Actually you used to do bad things all the time but now you have made God your boss and you really want to do whatever he wants. I thank God for this.
eng	But don’t worry about the trouble we get now. Later God will make everything so good for us that we will not even think about the trouble we get now.
eng	Or maybe God gave you the power to cheer people up, well this is your job. Or maybe he gave you the power to share your money and things with other people, well he wants you to share it with people
eng	that need things. Or maybe God gave you the power to be a leader, well you have to try to lead people properly. Or if God gave you the power to feel sorry for people that have troubles, and the power
eng	God’s law says, “Love other people just as much as you love yourself.” You know there are lots of other laws too, like, “Don’t sleep with people that you are not married to, as if they are
eng	they are your wives or husbands,” and, “Don’t murder anybody,” and, “Don’t steal anything,” and, “Don’t think about getting something for yourself if it belongs to somebody else.”
eng	But if you really love other people you will not do any of these wrong things anyway. So this law, that says to love people, it says what all the other laws put together are saying.
eng	and he picked me out to be a special worker for Jesus Christ. My job is to tell the good news about Jesus to you mob that are not Jews. Then God’s spirit works in you to make you good and right,
eng	I’m sending this letter to you Christians there in the city called Corinth. God picked you to be his own special people and he joined you to Jesus Christ. You are in God’s family now, along with
eng	People might reckon that is a stupid thing for God to do, but God’s way is better than the best idea any human has ever had. And people might reckon that God is weak. He just let his son die. But
eng	These are the things that we tell you about. We don’t use words that smart people taught us, but we use the words that God’s spirit teaches us. And we explain God’s message to people that have
eng	Listen. You know what will happen to bad people, don’t you? They will not be in God’s family. They will never get the good things that God will give to his people in heaven. Don’t let anyone
eng	trick you about this. I’ll tell you now about the kind of people that will not be in God’s family. People that play around with somebody they are not married to, and sleep with them, they will
eng	not be in God’s family. Or 2 men that sleep together and do what is wrong, they will not be in God’s family. And people that respect other spirits more than they respect God,
eng	But if she does leave him, she has to stay single. Or she can go back to her husband. And a husband has to stay with his wife.
eng	But maybe another man and his promised girl, those 2 decide to work for God and not to get married, and maybe the man still wants to stay single and he can control himself. Well, he can stay single
eng	You know, everyone that works gets some sort of pay for their work. You know about soldiers. They don’t have to buy their own food or their gear. And you know about gardeners. They work, and they
eng	always eat some of the food they grow. And it is the same for people that look after cows. They work, and they can drink some of the milk they get. You see, it’s right for people to work and then
eng	get something for it. So, if my work is to tell you about Jesus, it’s right for you to give me something for my work. But I never ask you to give me anything.
eng	My friends, do you remember the story about my mob, the Israel people, a long time ago? They all followed Moses and walked out into the hot dry country, and God covered them all with a big cloud, and
eng	this cloud showed them where to go. Then they came to the Red Sea and God pushed the water back so that they all walked through the Red Sea on dry ground.
eng	It’s like this, God made the first woman by taking a part of the first man, but after that every man was born from a woman. But everything really comes from God.
eng	And don’t come to that meeting hungry. If you are hungry, eat something at home before you come to the meeting, so when you meet together, you will not do wrong and God will not punish you.
eng	But we don’t need to cover the beautiful parts of our bodies. God has joined all these parts together to make one body. We might think some parts are not important, but God has made them really
eng	You know, I talked to you already about the special power that God gives to his people, and now I’m telling you that one day we will stop using that special power. But we can’t stop loving
eng	people. If you love somebody properly you will always love them. But the time will come when God will not need to give us special power any more. When that time comes God will not tell some people
eng	his special messages, and God will not get some people to talk in special languages, and God will not let some people know special things.
eng	You see, it is like this. If I pray in a special language, I’m not using my mind. I’m not thinking about my words while I pray. Only my spirit is praying.
eng	Maybe you think I’m wrong, but remember this, you don’t know everything in God’s word. It didn’t start with you, and you are not the only people that ever heard it.
eng	Listen, this is the true story. Jesus Christ died, and God made him alive again. Jesus was the first person to die and then come back to life again, and to live for ever.
eng	Every kind of thing that is alive has a different kind of body from every other kind of thing. People have one kind of body. Animals have a different kind of body. Birds have another kind of body,
eng	Do it like this. On the 1st day of every week, each of you can pick out some of the money that you got that week, and keep it in a separate place. I will come to you soon, and you will have this
eng	3-4 You see, Titus was there with me, and he is a Greek man, not a Jew. But there were some Jewish men that came secretly into the church in Jerusalem. They reckoned they believed in Jesus, but they
eng	didn’t really trust him properly. They only came into the church to see what we were doing. And they reckoned that Titus had to follow the Jewish law and have a young man’s operation. But, you
eng	And when we became God’s kids he sent his son’s spirit to live right inside us. His spirit in us gets us to call out to God, “My Dad, you are my father.”
eng	You see, it is like this. We all have a bad part in us that makes us want to do bad things, to make us feel good. And we also have God’s spirit in us, and he makes us want to do good things. These
eng	2 are both in you, and they both want to control you, so they are fighting each other inside you all the time. Whenever you listen to God’s spirit and try to do I good things, that bad part in you
eng	You see, it doesn’t matter whether anyone did a young man’s operation on you, or not. The most important thing is this. God changed you into a new person.
eng	You see, Jesus Christ has been good to us. He has given us each a spiritual gift. He gives each one of us the spiritual power to do something properly. He himself picks the one to get each gift.
eng	And don’t swear, or say anything that is bad. But say good things that will help people, and make them stronger. In this way your words will be good for those that hear you.
eng	Don’t get drunk. If you drink too much grog you will go wild and stupid. Don’t do that, but instead, let the Holy Spirit keep on filling you up.
eng	Now I’m talking to bosses. You have to do the same, you have to be good to your workers. Don’t say anything to frighten them. Don’t tell them you want to punish them. Remember that God in
eng	heaven is your boss, and he is the boss of your workers too. And he treats everyone the same, no matter whether you are a boss or a worker.
eng	3-4 Each of you has to think about what is good for the others. Don’t only think about what is good for yourself. Don’t think that you are better than other people, but think that they are better
eng	than you. And don’t do things only to get people to say you are good. Don’t try to be a boss over other people, but let others be boss over you.
eng	And all of us have to think like this if we are spiritually strong now and live properly for Jesus. But if you think differently about anything, God will help you and show you which way is right.
eng	But right now I have everything I need, and even more than I need. You gave all these things to Epaphroditus to bring to me, and I’m happy to get them. But you didn’t only give them to me. You
eng	But God got Jesus Christ to live in a human body and then die, so that now you can come back to God and be his friends. God did this so that later, at the time when God will judge everyone, he will
eng	And now I am talking to you fathers. Don’t be rough on your children. Don’t make them get angry with you, or they might stop trying to be good.
eng	And friends, do you know what happened to the people in the churches in Judea country? They believed in Jesus and their Jewish countrymen gave them a lot of trouble. And it is the same for you now.
eng	You believe in Jesus and your countrymen give you a lot of trouble. That Jewish mob didn’t want to believe God, and they made trouble for Jesus too.
eng	None of you men can ever sleep with a woman that is not your own wife. If you do that, you are taking something that belongs to another man. He is like your brother, but you are doing a bad thing to
eng	Our Christian friends, we know you are learning to trust God more and more, and you are loving each other more and more. So we have to thank God for you all the time.
eng	So then, friends, you have to keep strong and keep on properly trusting Jesus. Keep on believing the things that we taught you. You see, Jesus taught us those things, and later we taught them to you.
eng	We told you those things when we were there with you, and after that we wrote letters to you to tell you more. Keep on believing those things.
eng	3-4 Do you remember the time that we were in Ephesus, and I got up to go to Macedonia? At that time I wanted you to straighten out those people in Ephesus that teach the wrong message, so I told you
eng	to stay there. Those people think a lot about old time stories that are not true, and they think about the lists of names of people in their family. Then from there they teach people lies. People
eng	that listen to them just get into useless arguments. People shouldn’t do that, but they have to learn about God and the way he works. They have to learn to believe in God and to do whatever he
eng	And in your meetings, I want the women to dress properly and sensibly. They can’t dress in a way that makes men look at them. They can’t think about the fancy clothes they will wear, or their
eng	8-9 You sometimes hear people say, “If we train our bodies we will get fit to play sport and we will live better lives now, and that is a little bit good for us. But if we train our spirits to
eng	respect God and take notice of him we will not only live better lives now but we will live a lot better in the life that will come after we die, just like God promised us. That is a lot better for
eng	God says, “You have to pay the worker for his work.” God gives us an example of this in his law. We read in God’s book, “If you get an animal to work for you, you have to let that animal eat
eng	something when it works.” Well, it is like that too with the church leaders. They work for the church, so the church has to pay them properly.
eng	All right, Timothy, God gave you his good news, so you have to look after it properly. Make sure nobody changes it around. There are some people that have big discussions but say bad things about
eng	God. Don’t listen to them. They might reckon they know all about it and they might say that you are wrong, but really, they are the ones that are wrong.
eng	And you are also like a sportsman. You know that sportsmen have to follow the rules of their sport, otherwise they can’t win. Well, just like that, you have to follow the rules that God set down,
eng	Most people will only love themselves, and money. They will think that they are smart and they will tell everyone they are smart. They will say bad things about other people. They will never do what
eng	their parents tell them to do. They will never thank anyone for anything. They will not respect things that are belong to God.
eng	10-12 Almost all my friends went away to somewhere else. Demas just likes to have fun with the things that are around these days so he left me and went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia
eng	country, and Titus went to Dalmatia country. And I told Tychicus to go to Ephesus. Only Luke is here with me now. If Mark was here he could help me a lot in my work, so get him and bring him with you.
eng	And Titus, you know the lawyer called Zenas and his mate called Apollos. Those 2 men will be leaving your place soon to go on a trip. Please help them as much as you can. Make sure they have
eng	This is me, Paul, writing this with my own hand so you can be sure I mean it, I will pay that money back to you. But remember you already got a lot from me. I told you about Jesus and he gave you
eng	My dear friends, you have to be ready to listen to other people, and you have to stop and think before you say anything yourself. Stop and think before you get angry, too.
eng	Maybe you reckon, “Some people can believe in Jesus and other people can do the good things that Jesus says to do.” I answer like this, “You can’t show me that you believe in Jesus if you
eng	5-6 While you lived here on this earth you killed good people that couldn’t fight back. You lied and said they were guilty and then you killed them. While you were doing that you got everything you
eng	wanted and had plenty to eat. You are fat now, but look out. God will kill you. Think about a farmer and his cow. He feeds that cow a lot of grass and makes it fat, then he kills it to get some meat.
eng	You are trusting God and he is saving you, so you are really happy. You are so happy you can’t properly say how happy you are.
eng	Some of you are working men. You belong to your bosses. Maybe your boss is good to you, or maybe your boss is rough on you. It doesn’t matter. You have to listen carefully to your boss anyway and
eng	do whatever he tells you. Sometimes you do nothing wrong, but your boss makes trouble for you or hits you because you are following Jesus. You have to respect him anyway and take it quietly. Don’t
