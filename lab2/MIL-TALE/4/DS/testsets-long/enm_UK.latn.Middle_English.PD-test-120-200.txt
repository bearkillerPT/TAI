enm	And Moises stood in the yate of the castels, and seide, If ony man is of the Lord, be he ioyned to me; and alle the sones of Leuy weren gaderid to hym.
enm	Therfor Moises was there with the Lord bi fourti daies and bi fourti nyytis, he eet not breed, and drank not watir; and he wroot in tablys ten wordis of the boond of pees.
