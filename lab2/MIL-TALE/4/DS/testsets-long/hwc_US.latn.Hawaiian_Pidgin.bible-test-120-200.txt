hwc	Dis book tell bout Jesus an his ancesta guys. He da Christ, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send. He from King David ohana, an David, he from Abraham ohana.
hwc	But eh! I telling you guys dis: No fight back da bad guys. If anybody slap yoa head one side, mo betta let um slap da odda side too.
hwc	Wen Jesus go inside his house, da blind guys go inside dea too. Jesus tell um, “Fo real kine, you guys trus me, dat I can make you guys see?”
hwc	If no mo nobody take you guys in, an dey no like hear wat you say, wen you go outa dea, dust da dust from yoa feet, fo show da peopo dea dat God no like, cuz dey no listen.
hwc	Same time, John Da Baptiza Guy, he stay in jail. He hear all da stuff Jesus stay doing. (Jesus was da Christ guy, you know, da Spesho Guy God Wen Send.) So John wen go send his guys fo talk to Jesus.
hwc	“Wen one bad kine spirit let go one guy, dat spirit go all ova da boonies fo find one place fo rest, but no can find notting.
hwc	Dis wat wen happen. Befo time, you know, Herod wen tell his guys fo grab John, an put chain on top um, an throw um inside da prison. Herod do dat cuz a Herodias, his brudda Philipʼs wife.
hwc	All dat bad kine stuff, dass wat come from inside da heart. Dass why peopo stay pilau inside an dey no can pray. But if get one guy dat no wash his hands da right way, an den he eat, dat no goin make
hwc	You guys no undastan, still yet? Wen I wen broke da five breads fo da five tousand guys, how much baskets you guys wen pick up afta? Tink bout dat.
hwc	An I tell you guys dis too: If one wahine neva go fool aroun, an her husban still yet go throw her out, an den he marry one nodda wahine, da first one still yet stay his wife. Da guy ony fooling
hwc	Den Jesus dem come near Jerusalem an come to Betpage, da small town on top Olive Ridge. Jesus tell two guys he teaching,
hwc	But Jesus know dey trying fo make um any kine, an he say, “You guys, you say one ting an do one nodda! How come you guys trying fo make me say any kine?
hwc	You guys no can see notting, an you guys try fo show da odda guys wea fo go! You guys pick out one small fly from inside da soup, but den jalike you guys let one big camel stay inside da soup, an you
hwc	“Daniel, da guy dat wen talk fo God befo time, he wen say dat someting dat God hate plenny, goin happen. Dat ting so bad, goin mess up everyting an make everybody jus bag. Da ting goin stand inside
hwc	Dat time, da main priest guys an da older leadas fo da peopo wen come togedda inside da Head Priest guy palace. Kaiafas, he da Head Priest dat time.
hwc	Den da Head Priest guy wen stand up an say, “Eh, you no hear wat dese guys saying bout you? You no goin say notting, o wat?”
hwc	You wen say dat you goin broke down da temple an goin build um up again befo three days pau! So, we like see you get yoaself outa dis! If you Godʼs Boy, come down from da cross now!”
hwc	You know, Johnʼs clotheses come from da camel hair. He wen make one rope outa leather fo belt. He eat grasshoppas, an he get honey from da bees.
hwc	An same ting, you no put grape juice fo make wine inside one old kine leather bag, an close um fo let um ferment. You do dat, da new wine goin come mo big an bus da wine bag, an da wine goin spill
hwc	Afta six days, Jesus wen take Peter, James, an John wit him up on top one big mountain wea neva have nobody. Den, da same time dey stay looking at him, Jesus wen start fo look diffren in front dem.
hwc	cuz he teaching his guys stuff. He tell um, “I da Guy Dass Fo Real. Da peopo goin set me up, an take me. Dey goin kill me, an on day numba three I goin come back alive.”
hwc	Wen Jesus wen see wat his guys doing, he huhu. He say, “Let da kids come! No stop dem! Cuz da peopo who make God dea King, inside demself dey jalike dese kids.
hwc	Jesus say, “Eh, all you guys! Come ova hea! You know, da leadas fo da peopos dat donno God, dey get any kine power ova dea peopo. Dea main guys get da rights fo tell da peopo wat fo do.
hwc	One teacha who teach Godʼs Rules was standing dea. He hear dem talking, an he know dat Jesus wen shut up da Sadducee guys. So he aks him, “Eh, from all da Rules God wen give us, wat da main
hwc	Plenny guys goin show up an use my name. Dey goin say, ‘Eh, me, I dat Spesho Christ Guy from God!’ An dey goin fool plenny peopo lidat.
hwc	“Nobody know wen all dat goin happen, not even da day, o da time. Da angel messenja guys inside da sky, even dem, dey donno. Even me, I Godʼs Boy, an I donno da time. Ony my Fadda know da time!
hwc	Dass right! An I telling you guys, afta dis I no goin drink notting from da grape vine again till da time come wen we all stay togedda wea God stay King. Dat time, I goin drink da new kine wine.”
hwc	Da main priest guys an all da main leadas wen try find proof agains Jesus so dey can kill him, but dey neva find notting.
hwc	Now, Pilate know dat da main priest guys wen give Jesus to him cuz dey so mad at Jesus, cuz everybody listen to him an not dem.
hwc	Befo time, Moses wen write down inside Godʼs Rules, all da stuff dat peopo gotta do wen one baby born, cuz da mudda kapu fo forty days an no can go pray wit da odda peopo. But wen pau da kapu, da
hwc	mudda an da fadda gotta make sacrifice, den she can go pray wit da odda peopo. So wen da time come, Joseph an Mary wen take Jesus to Jerusalem fo bring him inside da Temple, in front da Boss.
hwc	John tell, “Da guy dat get two coats gotta give one to da guy dat no mo coat. An da guy dat get food gotta give to da guy dat no mo food.”
hwc	Fo forty days da Devil wen try presha Jesus fo do bad kine stuff. Jesus neva eat notting dat time, an afta dat he hungry.
hwc	Jesus go inside Simonʼs boat, an tell him fo go out litto bit from da beach. Den Jesus sit down an teach da peopo from dea.
hwc	Den da Pharisee guys an dea friends wen say, “Plenny times, da guys dat John Da Baptiza guy teach, dey no eat so dey can pray. An da guys dat da Pharisee guys teach, dey no eat so dey can pray. But
hwc	Jesus wen come down da hill wit his guys, an he stand on top one flat place. Had plenny guys dea dat wen go wit him an plenny odda peopo from Jerusalem an all ova Judea, an from Tyre an Sidon, two
hwc	No way! Get love an aloha fo da peopo dat stay agains you, an do um good, an lend um stuff, an no tink if you goin get um back! Cuz da God Dass Mo Importan Den All Da Odda Gods, he everytime do good
hwc	to da peopo dat no tank him an da peopo dat do real bad kine stuff. If you make like God, dat show dat he you guys Fadda, an you his kids. An bumbye, God goin have plenny good kine stuff bumbye in da
hwc	Everybody wen come real scared, an dey wen talk good bout God lidis, “One importan guy dat talk fo God wen come by us! God wen come fo take care his peopo!”
hwc	Den he tell um, “Whoeva take in one small kid jalike dis kid cuz da kid my guy, dat guy take me in too. An whoeva take me in, dey take in da One dat wen send me too. Da guy dat put himself last, he
hwc	An you guys from Capernaum town, you tink God goin take you up in da sky wit him, o wat? No way! Mo like he goin throw you guys down inside Hell, cuz you guys neva listen!”
hwc	Wen Jesus go way from dat place, da teachas dat teach Godʼs Rules an da Pharisee guys wen start fo gang up on him, an try fo make him tell dem all kine stuff.
hwc	You guys, you goin see Abraham, Isaac, an Jacob, an all da guys dat wen talk fo God, an dey goin stay dea wit God da King, but he goin throw you guys outside. Den you guys goin cry an grind yoa teet
hwc	Da boss tell da worka guy, ‘Go out by da big an small roads in da country side an make da peopo come in, so my house can come full.
hwc	Jesus tell um, “You da guys dat tell da peopo you do da right kine stuff, but God know how you guys stay inside. Da stuff da peopo tink stay real good, dass da stuff God tink no good.”
hwc	From den, every day Jesus teach inside da temple yard. Da main priest guys, da teachas dat teach Godʼs Rules, an da leadas fo da peopo wen like kill um,
hwc	So da guys dat stay watching him tell him, “Eh, Teacha, we know dat you talk strait an wat you say an teach stay true. You do da same to everybody, an you teach Godʼs way fo real kine.
hwc	Den he take da bread, an tell God “Mahalo,” an broke um, an give um to dem. He say, “Dis hea, my body dat I give up fo you guys. From now, tink bout me everytime you eat dis.”
hwc	Dey come to da place name “Da Skull.” Dey hang Jesus on top da cross fo kill him dea. Dey hang da two crook guys on top da odda two crosses, one on da right side an da odda on da left side.
hwc	Den da guy tell da groom, “Everybody bring out da real good wine first. Den, afta dea friends drink plenny, dey bring out da cheap wine. But you, you wen bring out da bestes kine wine now!”
hwc	Jesus tell her, “If you wen know wat God like give everybody, an who me dat stay aks you fo water, den you aks me fo water, an I give you da kine water dat make peopo live fo real kine foeva.”
hwc	Plenny Samaritan peopo from dat town wen trus Jesus cuz a wat da wahine wen tell dem. She say, “He wen tell me everyting I eva do.”
hwc	Jesus tell dem, “Dass good you guys stay looking fo me. But I like tell you guys dis: You guys do um cuz I wen give you guys bread, an you guys wen come full. You guys no stay looking fo me cuz I
hwc	Da Jewish leada guys, wen blow dea minds. Dey say, “How come dis bugga know all dis stuff? He neva study wit da odda teachas, you know.”
hwc	Jesus say, “Dis fo shua wat I telling you guys: If get one place fo da sheeps, an somebody no go inside dea by da gate, but he go climb ova da wall one nodda place, dat guy ony like steal da sheeps.
hwc	If we let him stay do dis kine stuff, everybody goin go trus him jalike he dea king! An cuz a dat, da Rome army guys goin come an wipe out our temple an our peopo.”
hwc	Cuz you wen make me in charge a da peopo all ova da world, I goin make everybody you wen give me come alive fo real kine foeva.
hwc	Da priest guys tell Pilate, “Us guys no can do dat, cuz us guys no mo da right fo kill nobody da Rome way, on top one cross.”
hwc	Da first day in da week, Mary from Magdala wen come back to da place dey wen bury Jesus. She come dea wen dark time still yet. She wen see da big stone Jesus friends wen use fo close da place afta
hwc	Den he tell Thomas, “Put yoa finga ova hea an check out my hands. Put out yoa hand, an touch my side. Now, no say you no believe I alive fo real kine. Believe!”
hwc	But God wen make him come back alive again from mahke. He no need suffa an mahke again, cuz a wat God wen do. He no can stay mahke, cuz he mo strong.
hwc	He wen promise all dat fo you guys an yoa kids, an fo all da peopo dat no stay tight wit God -- all da ones da Boss our God goin tell fo come to him.”
hwc	Moses wen tell, you know, ‘God yoa Boss, he goin give you guys one Guy goin be jalike me, dat goin talk fo God. He goin come from da Jewish peopo. You guys gotta listen an do everyting he tell
hwc	Wen dea own peopo wen hear dat, dey wen pray togedda lidis: “Boss, you da King. You wen make da sky, da earth, an da sea, an everyting dat stay inside dem.
hwc	Da guys Jesus send wen do plenny awesome stuff da show who dem in front da peopo. All da peopo dat trus God wen come togedda inside Solomonʼs Lanai.
hwc	Jesus guys wen go way from da main leadas. An dey wen stay real good inside cuz God figga dey stay good nuff fo suffa shame cuz dey Jesus guys.
hwc	I goin punish da peopo dat make dem slaves. An latas, yoa ohana guys goin go way from ova dea, an dey goin pray an show me respeck in dis place.’ Dass wat God wen say.
hwc	Moses, he da same guy dat wen tell da Israel peopo lata, ‘God goin send one Guy fo you dat goin talk fo him, jalike he wen send me. An dat One goin come from you guys ohana.’
hwc	But Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen take charge a him. An he look up to da sky, an see how awesome God stay, an Jesus standing by Godʼs right side.
hwc	Den Simon wen tell Peter an John, “You can pray to da Boss fo me, so dat all dis stuff dat you wen say no happen to me?”
hwc	Saul stay going on da road, an come near Damascus. An you know wat? Right den an dea one light from da sky wen flash aroun him.
hwc	Da Jewish guys dat trus Jesus an wen come wit Peter, wen blow dea minds, cuz Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen take charge a even da peopo dat not Jews.
hwc	Had guys dat wen talk fo God an guys dat wen teach wit da church guys in Antiok: Barnabas, Simeon da Black guy, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen (da guy dat wen grow up wit King Herod), an Saul.
hwc	Wen dey wen kill Jesus, wen happen jalike da Bible wen say. An afta, dey wen take him down from da cross an wen put him inside one tomb.
hwc	Paul an Barnabas wen tell da Good Stuff From God Derbe town, an plenny peopo wen learn bout Jesus an come his guys. Den dey wen go back Lystra town, an Iconium, an Antiok.
hwc	Paul wen start fo talk, but Governa Gallio wen tell da Jews, “If you Jewish guys wen squawk bout someting dat stay wrong o some crime, den dass good fo me fo listen to you guys.
hwc	He wen stay ova dea three months. He stay ready fo sail Syria side, but da Jewish guys wen make plan fo kill him, so he wen go back thru Macedonia.
hwc	But da peopo dat not Jews an stay tight wit Jesus, we wen awready write dem one letta. We tell um dey betta not eat da meat from da sacrifices fo da idol kine gods, o blood, o da meat from da animals
hwc	He say, ‘Our ancestas God wen pick you fo know wat he like do, an fo see Christ, da Guy Dat Stay Right, an fo hear wat he say.
hwc	Wen da sun wen come up, da Jewish guys wen come togedda an wen make plan bout Paul. Dey make promise dat dey no goin eat o drink notting till dey pau kill him.
hwc	Festus wen like do someting fo da Jewish guys, so he wen tell Paul, “You like go Jerusalem an stand in front me ova dea fo tell bout all dis stuff?”
hwc	Plenny times I wen go from one Jewish church to da odda fo punish um, an I wen try fo make um talk stink agains God. I wen come plenny huhu wit dem, an I even wen go da towns far away fo make um
hwc	We wen lose plenny time, an da Spesho Day Fo Pray An No Eat wen come awready. Da ocean wen stay too rough fo sail dat time. So Paul wen tell um,
hwc	Wen da sun wen come up, dey neva know da land wea dey was. But dey wen spock one bay an one sandy beach. Dey wen tink stay mo betta fo make da boat eat it ova dea.
hwc	Dey wen go way an make argue wit each odda. But first Paul wen say, “Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen tell yoa ancesta guys da trut! Isaiah wen talk fo him
hwc	I really like stay by you guys, cuz I like share da good kine stuff from Godʼs Spirit wit you guys. Den you can stay mo strong an mo solid inside.
hwc	Befo time, wen still yet neva have da Rules from God, all ova da world had peopo dat was doing bad kine stuff. But wen neva have da Rules, nobody wen go write down wat da bad kine stuff peopo do.
hwc	Wat good kine ting you guys wen get from all dat stuff you wen do? Notting! Now you guys get plenny shame weneva you guys tink bout um. Cuz wen you do dat kine stuff, you ony cut yoaself off from God.
hwc	Even if we do wat da Rules from God say, dat no can throw out da bad kine stuff inside us, cuz da way us guys stay, we not strong inside. But den God, he wen go send his own Boy fo come one guy
hwc	jalike us. Da way Jesus wen stay, God wen make him look jalike one regula guy dat can do bad kine stuff, jalike all da odda peopo. But den, Jesus neva do bad kine stuff -- how he wen live, he wen
hwc	show proof dat da tings da peopo was doing was bad fo shua. Plus, he wen come one sacrifice fo hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff dat all da odda peopo wen do.
hwc	An den, who goin poin finga da peopo God wen pick? No mo nobody fo do dat! Cuz God, he da One dat say dat his peopo get um right wit him awready.
hwc	Eh, who you tink you? How come you talk back lidat to God, brudda? Jalike da Bible wen tell: “If get one guy dat making one ting, da ting no can tell da guy, ‘Eh! How come you wen make me
hwc	So den, wat? Wat we goin say? Get all kine peopos from diffren place dat not Jews, dey neva was trying fo get um right wit God befo time. Now, dey get um right wit him, cuz dey stay trus um.
hwc	Fo shua, he like give um chance, an dass why he wen pick um. No was cuz dey wen go do someting good, an dass why he gotta pick um, you know. If he gotta pick um cuz a da good tings dey wen do, den he
hwc	Dat mean, if get somebody dat go agains da kine peopo dat get dat kine power, az jalike dey going agains da way how God wen go make one govermen fo us. If get anybody dat make lidat, dey goin get it
hwc	Eh, bruddas an sistas, I aks you guys fo pray hard wit me dat God goin help me. You guys pray cuz Jesus Christ yoa Boss, an cuz Godʼs Spirit give you guys love an aloha.
hwc	He da ony God dat stay, an he know everyting. I like everybody tell how awesome he stay foeva, cuz a wat Jesus Christ wen do! Dass it!
hwc	Cuz no matta da peopo tink God stupid, he still mo smart den dem. No matta dey tink God not strong, he still mo strong den dem.
hwc	Me an Apollos an Peter, we stay fo you guys! An da whole world stay fo you guys, no matta you alive o mahke! Everyting dat stay happening right now, an everyting dat goin happen lata -- everyting
hwc	Us guys, we jalike da Bread Dat No Mo Yeast Inside, dat da Jewish peopo make fo eat Passova time. So us guys gotta watch out dat we no do da bad kine stuff, o hurt da odda peopo. We wen make lidat
hwc	No hold back from each odda. You can fo short time, but ony if da husban an da wife tell each odda dey goin hold back fo get time fo pray. An den come back togedda, so da Devil no can make you guys
hwc	presha make you fool aroun behind da oddaʼs back. But if you no come back togedda fast, you no goin be strong nuff fo say “No!” to da Devil.
hwc	I telling you guys dis stuff, cuz good fo you guys. I no like jam up you guys. I like you guys do da right ting, an know wat da Boss like you fo do an be ready fo do um, an no worry bout odda kine
hwc	All dat stuff wen happen fo show us guys dat we not suppose to go all out fo do da bad kine stuff, jalike all da peopo dea.
hwc	I get someting I like tell you folks -- you all good guys, cuz you guys tink bout me all da time, no matta wat. All da stuff I wen teach you guys, you guys still yet stay do um. Right on!
hwc	Wen da Boss punish us guys, you know, he do dat fo teach us guys da right way. He no like us get punish an wipe out wit all da peopo inside da world, bumbye.
hwc	If one part a da body suffa, all da odda parts suffa, same time. If one part a da body stay awesome, all da odda parts feel good, same time.
hwc	But if I donno wat dea language mean, da peopo dat stay talking lidat, I goin know dat dey not from my peopo, an dey goin know dat I not from dea peopo.
hwc	Wot! If you guys no like, try tink bout dis: Who was da guys dat wen start fo tell wat God say, first time? Was you guys? Nah! O you guys tink you da ony peopo dat eva hear wat God say? Get real!
hwc	Da Bible wen say befo time, “God make his Spesho Guy be da boss ova everyting.” But you know, wen he say “everyting get him fo boss” -- fo shua, he not talking bout God, da One dat wen make
hwc	Az why I wen write befo dat I not going yet, so dat you guys can make everyting right, an den wen I go ova dea, I no goin feel all sad cuz a you guys dat suppose to make me feel good inside. I know
hwc	But weneva somebody start fo trus da Boss, Christ help um undastan inside dea hearts. Jalike da Bible wen tell bout Moses, “He take away da ting dat cover his face.”
hwc	You know, we all gotta go in front Christ da Judge, an no can hide notting. Dat time we goin get back wat we wen do wen we wen stay inside dis world, da good kine stuff o da no good kine stuff.
hwc	But I tell you guys dis: “Da guy who plant litto bit seed, he goin get one small crop. Da guy dat plant plenny seed wit good heart, he goin get mo plenny crop, an he goin stay good inside.”
hwc	An dis too: every day I feel da presha fo tink hard bout all da bruddas an sistas dat come togedda fo God all ova da place.
hwc	Christ neva have power wen dey wen kill him on top da cross. An us guys neva have power jalike Christ get power. But God wen give Christ da power fo live now, an he wen give us da power fo live too
hwc	Dass why you guys not jalike slaves no moa dat gotta do wat da Rules say. Now you guys Godʼs kids! An God goin give you guys everyting he goin give his kids.
hwc	Wat da Bible say? “Throw out da slave wahine an her boy, cuz her boy no goin get da good stuff da fadda like give his wifeʼs boy.”
hwc	Wen we stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, dass da first proof fo show us all da good kine stuff God goin give his kids. Bumbye God goin cut loose his kids from all da power dat da bad kine stuff get ova
hwc	Try pray fo me too, so wen I tell da Good Kine Stuff From God, I tell um da right way an I no scared. You know, nobody wen undastan dat stuff befo time, cuz was secret.
hwc	Dey tell, “Fo be Godʼs guy fo real kine, gotta cut skin.” But you know, us guys, we da guys dat get Godʼs Spirit. Dass jalike da mark fo show dat we Godʼs guys fo real kine, not dem. Cuz wen
hwc	we do stuff fo God, da Spirit help us do um, dass why. Us guys can feel real proud cuz we stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Guy, Jesus Christ. We no tink we okay jus cuz somebody wen do someting to our
hwc	Watch out! No let nobody hemo you guys from da trut! Dey goin try teach you guys wrong kine stuff wit any kine talk. Dey get all dis kine teaching ony from peopo, from now an from befo time, an from
hwc	Let Christ take charge a you guys an make yoa hearts rest inside. He wen tell all you guys fo come togedda an stay togedda jalike one ohana. An tank God everytime fo everyting.
hwc	Every time us guys go pray, we talk to God bout all you guys, an we say, “Mahalo plenny, God, fo da church peopo Tessalonika side!”
hwc	An we wen send Timoty so you guys no presha out wen peopo make you suffa. Cuz you guys know awready dat God let dat kine stuff happen to all us guys.
hwc	Cuz you guys know awready dat da time wen da Boss goin come back, goin be jalike wen one steala guy go sneak inside yoa house nite time, an you no expeck.
hwc	Eh bruddas an sistas, we jus gotta tell God “Mahalo plenny!” everytime cuz a you guys. Az right we do dat, cuz you guys stay trus God plenny mo an moa, an cuz you guys stay showing mo an mo love
hwc	Da stuff I telling you now stay true, an you can trus um: Godʼs Spesho Guy Jesus wen come hea inside dis world, fo take peopo outa da bad kine stuff dey doing. I da one wen do mo plenny bad kine
hwc	Da main leada guy gotta do everyting da right way, so nobody can poin finga. He ony can have one wife. He no drink plenny cuz he gotta stay in charge a himself. He tink befo he do tings. He akamai an
hwc	Stay away from da lolo kine stories an da kine stories dat no mo respeck notting fo God. Mo betta, do da kine tings God like everytime.
hwc	In front God, Jesus Christ, an da angel guys God wen pick, I tell you dis: Do all dis tings. No ony make some peopo do um an same time let odda peopo no do um.
hwc	An you know wat? Everybody dat like live da way God like, an stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Guy Jesus Christ, peopo goin make dem suffa.
hwc	Jesus wen send me fo help all da guys God wen pick fo trus him. An anodda ting -- he send me fo help dem know fo shua da trut bout da way we suppose to be wen we come close to God.
hwc	How come us guys gotta make lidat? Cuz God wen show everybody he get good heart fo help dem, an dass why he can take everybody outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing.
hwc	But I ony one old man name Paul, in jail cuz I stay tight wit Christ, so I like you try do someting cuz you get plenny love an aloha fo me.
hwc	But Christ, he da Faddaʼs Boy, an cuz a dat, he stay in charge a Godʼs peopo. An you know, us guys Godʼs peopo. If we hang in dea, an no mo shame fo come tight wit God, we everytime goin talk bout
hwc	Who da peopo he talking bout dat wen go agains Moses, afta dey wen hear wat he say? Az was all da peopo dat Moses wen bring outa Egypt.
hwc	You know, dat head priest guy, he get plenny respeck. But nobody can make himself da head priest guy, cuz dass one spesho job. God gotta be da One fo pick da guy, jalike da first time, he wen pick
hwc	Wen peopo make one strong promise, dey make um by somebody mo big den dem, so den everybody know dat dey goin do um. Dat show dey really mean um. An den wen dass all pau, da odda peopo no can make
hwc	An cuz God wen make one strong promise to Jesus lidat, garans Jesus da One dat goin make shua us guys goin get one mo betta deal.
hwc	Same ting, az why da first deal God wen make befo time, dat deal wen need blood from one animal sacrifice fo make da deal good.
hwc	All dose peopo, dey wen trus God all da time till dey mahke. No matta dey neva get da stuff God wen promise, dey know dat dey goin get um bumbye. Dey stay good inside, jalike dey see um awready from
hwc	Da whole time us guys running da race, we ony stay looking at one guy, dass Jesus. He da One dat wen help us start trussing God, an he help us trus God all da way. Wen he wen suffa on top da cross,
hwc	he wen hang in dea, an neva bodda him dat dey wen make him shame. He do dat cuz he know dat bumbye he goin stay real good inside. An in da end, he sit down in da mos importan place, by Godʼs throne,
hwc	Dat time was Godʼs voice dat wen make da earth shake. But now, he wen make promise. He say, “One mo time I goin make da earth shake, an I goin make da sky shake too.”
hwc	I like you guys know dis: our brudda Timoty, he outa jail awready! If he come hea quick, den he goin go wit me fo see you guys.
hwc	Wat if get two guys dat come to yoa church meeting. One guy get one gold ring, an he all dress up. An da odda guy poor, an ony get puka kine clotheses.
hwc	My bruddas an sistas, no talk stink bout each odda. If one guy talk stink bout one brudda, an make himself jalike one judge fo his brudda, dass mean same time he stay tell dat da Rules from God no
hwc	stay good, cuz dey say he no can judge his brudda. He tink he da judge so he can say dat da Rules no good. If you say da Rules no good, den you no goin do wat da Rules say. You ack jalike you know
hwc	God da Fadda wen pick you guys fo be his guys, cuz he wen know you guys way befo you guys was born. Godʼs Spirit wen make you guys spesho fo him, so you guys can do everyting Jesus Christ tell you
hwc	guys fo do. Jesus wen mahke fo you guys. Wen you guys do everyting Jesus tell you fo do, dass jalike God sprinkle Jesus blood on top you guys fo show dat you guys stay spesho fo him.
hwc	You worka guys, listen to yoa boss, an get respeck fo dem. Not ony fo da boss dat make good to you, but fo da boss dat give you hard time too.
hwc	But you can stay good inside, cuz you suffa togedda wit Christ. Den bumbye you goin come plenny good inside wen everybody see how awesome he stay.
hwc	I like you guys know God an Jesus our Boss mo betta, so den, dey goin do plenny good stuff fo you guys, an make yoa hearts rest inside.
hwc	Da angel guys, dey mo strong den dem teacha guys. No matta da angel guys get mo plenny power, dey no talk stink bout da awesome guys in front da Boss, an dey no poin finga dem.
hwc	From da time everyting had start, had one Guy, “Godʼs Talk,” dass who him. He da One dat can make da peopo come alive inside fo real. You know, me an da odda guys dat was wit Jesus, we wen hear
hwc	Whoeva Godʼs kids no stay do bad kine stuff, cuz jalike God stay live inside dem now. Dey no stay do bad kine stuff, cuz dey come from God.
hwc	My friends, I wen like write you guys real bad, fo tell you guys mo bout how God wen take all us guys outa da bad kine stuff. But now, I gotta write you guys dis: God wen teach da peopo dat stay
hwc	“Eh, I know everyting wat you guys doing! I know dat everybody tell dat you guys stay alive fo real kine! But dass bulai, cuz I know dat you guys stay mahke inside.
hwc	Afta dat, jalike one dream, I wen see four angel guys standing by da four corners a da earth. Dey was holding back da four winds so dey no can blow on top da land o da sea o on any tree.
