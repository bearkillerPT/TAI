eng	First of all, a long time ago, God made everything. He made
eng	everything that is in the sky, and he made everything that is on
eng	the earth. God made all the things that are everywhere.
eng	When this all happened, there was night time and there was
eng	morning time. That was day number 5.
eng	God put the man into the garden and gave him a job. He had to
eng	look after the garden and make sure all the plants grew strong

eng	Then Adam lived for another 800 years after Seth was born, and
eng	he had more sons and daughters.
eng	He called his son Noah. Lamech said, “God cursed the ground.
eng	We have to work hard to dig the ground, but Noah will help us to
eng	be happy, even though we have to work hard.”
eng	After that, God said to Noah, “You are the only man that lives
eng	the right way. Get your family and take them into the big boat.
eng	Then, 6 weeks later, Noah opened the window in the top of the
eng	big boat. He wanted to find out if the water went down, and if a
eng	bird could find some dry ground.
eng	And I promise this to all the animals that live on the earth,
eng	too, all the birds, and all the quiet animals, and all the wild
eng	animals. I promise this to all of the animals that came out of

eng	Each one had their own language, and their own land. Ham’s
eng	sons were Cush, and Egypt, and Put, and Canaan.

eng	from Shem. Each one had their own country and their own language.

eng	God and they will be really happy.
eng	But now I’m telling you this, husbands and wives have to stay
eng	married to each other. Only if a man’s wife sleeps with
eng	another man, as if he is her husband, only then can her proper
eng	husband divorce her. But if a wife never does that, her husband
eng	can’t divorce her. If he divorces her, he is forcing her to go
eng	and sleep with another man, and that is wrong. And if another
eng	man marries her, he is doing wrong too.”
eng	Don’t be like them. God, your Father, knows what you need
eng	already, even before you ask him.
eng	And don’t worry about how long you will live, or when you will
eng	die. No matter how much you worry about it you will not live any
eng	longer, not even one day longer.
eng	So, to find out if a person is good or bad, look at what they
eng	do. A good person does good things. And a bad person does bad

eng	said to Jesus, “Sir, I will come with you. But my father has
eng	died, so let me go home to bury him. After that, I will come

eng	those birds, so don’t be frightened. He knows you properly. He
eng	even knows how many hairs you have on your head. So he will only
eng	let things happen to you that will be good for you.”
eng	Then Jesus said, “John the Baptiser is a very important man.
eng	He is greater than any other man that ever lived. But everyone
eng	in God’s family is more important than John the Baptiser.
eng	He will not fight with anyone or shout at people.

eng	Capernaum. There were some men that worked in God’s ceremony
eng	house. Every year they collected the tax money that all the
eng	Jewish people had to pay to look after God’s ceremony house.
eng	Those men went to Peter and asked him, “Is your teacher going
eng	to pay the tax money for God’s ceremony house?”
eng	Then the big boss got the worker to come in, and said to him,
eng	‘You are really bad. You asked me to forget about all my money
eng	that you borrowed. It was millions of dollars. And I was good to
eng	you. I said you didn’t have to give it back to me.
eng	Jesus talked to the Jewish leaders. He said, “Tell me what you
eng	think about this picture story. A man had 2 sons. He went to the
eng	oldest son and said, ‘Son, go and work on our farm today.’
eng	So those 5 stupid ladies went to buy some oil. While they were
eng	away, that man came to the house to get married. The 5 other
eng	ladies were ready, and they went with him into the house, and

eng	they do that, we’ll be worse off than before. So we want

eng	2-3 A long time before Jesus was born, God told a man called
eng	Isaiah to write about the things God was going to do for Jesus
eng	some time later. Isaiah wrote,
eng	Like before, Jesus called out to James and John to stop their
eng	work and follow him. Straight away they left their father and
eng	the other workmen in the boat, and they followed Jesus.
eng	But the man didn’t do what Jesus said. He went away and told
eng	everyone, “Jesus made me better.” After people heard the
eng	man’s story they came from everywhere. Lots of people came to
eng	Jesus. He couldn’t walk by himself in the towns any more.
eng	There were too many people. So he had to stay out in the bush.
eng	But people still came from everywhere and found him.
eng	The Jewish law men saw Jesus’s followers eating those seeds,
eng	and those law men got upset. They growled at Jesus and said,
eng	“Your mob are doing the wrong thing. Our Jewish law says that
eng	today is the rest day. But your mob are getting seeds off those
eng	plants. That is work. They are breaking our law.”
eng	“You mob listen to me now. A man wanted to grow some seed food
eng	26-29 Jesus kept on teaching, and said, “I want you to know
eng	the way God’s family grows. This is another picture story. A
eng	man wanted to grow some seed food, so he threw some seeds on the
eng	ground. The seeds fell on the ground and after that the man
eng	walked away and left the seeds there. Those seeds grew all by
eng	themselves and that man didn’t know what made those seeds
eng	grow. He just left them there for many days and they grew. God
eng	made those seeds grow in the ground. At first the long stick
eng	part grew, and after that the head part grew with all the seeds
eng	inside it. At the right time God made the seeds get hard, ready
eng	for people to cut down those plants and pick up the seed food.
eng	God is boss for everyone and his family will grow just like the

eng	house.” He only let a few people go with him. They were the
eng	girl’s father and mother, and Peter, and James and his young
eng	brother John. They were the only ones that went with him.
eng	John’s friends heard this bad news. They came and got his
eng	body, then they took it away and buried it.
eng	Night time came, and Jesus was still on the land all alone, and
eng	the boat was half-way across the lake.

eng	called Phoenicia in Syria. Her daughter had a bad spirit inside
eng	her. So that woman went to Jesus to get help. She got down on
eng	her knees in front of Jesus, to show him respect, and she asked
eng	him to force the bad spirit out of her daughter.
eng	Jesus was a little bit upset. He breathed deeply and said,
eng	“You mob that are alive today always want to see something
eng	powerful before you will believe that God sent me. Listen, I’m
eng	telling you straight, I will not do anything powerful for you
eng	Jesus looked at the other followers there, then he said strongly
eng	to Peter, “Go away from me. You are like Satan. You are not
eng	thinking God’s way. You are just thinking like a man.”
eng	Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has your boy been

eng	of trouble. He wants to test you to see if you are walking

eng	So Jesus called them all together and said, “You know what
eng	government people are like here in this world. They like to be
eng	bosses over everybody. It is like that everywhere in this world,
eng	the leaders boss everyone around and the big bosses like to show
eng	everyone that they are strong.
eng	12-13 The next morning Jesus and his followers started to walk
eng	from Bethany back to Jerusalem. Jesus saw a tree not far away.
eng	It was the kind of tree that gets fruit called figs. Jesus was
eng	hungry, so he went to look for some figs on that tree, but there
eng	was nothing. It had lots of leaves but no fruit. (It wasn’t
eng	the right time of the year yet for fruit.)
eng	The owner sent another man to the garden, but the men hit him
eng	with whips too, and they hit him on the head.
eng	Jesus said, “You mob have a problem. You don’t know God’s
eng	word properly and you don’t know about God’s power.
eng	Then Jesus sat down near the money box at God’s house. He
eng	watched the people put money in the box to give it to God. Some
eng	rich people put in a lot of money
eng	There will be a lot of people that will tell lies and say they
eng	are the special man from God called Christ, but they will be
eng	trying to trick you. Other people will tell lies and say they
eng	are talking God’s words, and they might do all kinds of clever
eng	things. These people will be thinking, ‘Maybe we can trick the
eng	people that God picked out for himself.’ But really, they
eng	They heard him say this and they were very happy. They promised
eng	to pay him money. So Judas kept thinking about this and waited
eng	for the right time to help them catch Jesus.
eng	Jesus and His followers came to the place called Gethsemane. He
eng	said to them, “I want you to sit here and wait for me. I’m

eng	God’s house and build another one in 3 days. Lots of men built
eng	this one, but I will build the new one just by myself.’”
eng	9-11 Pilate knew that the leaders of the Jewish ceremonies were
eng	jealous of Jesus and that was why they brought him to Pilate.
eng	They wanted Pilate to kill him. So when those Jerusalem people
eng	asked Pilate to let one prisoner go, he said, “All right. How
eng	about I let Jesus go, this man you say is your big boss. What do
eng	Some of the people standing around heard the words that Jesus
eng	said. They thought that he called out for Elijah to come to him

eng	him.” But they didn’t believe her.

eng	But the people in that community said, “No. He is going to
eng	Jerusalem. We don’t like that Jerusalem mob, so he is not our
eng	friend. He can’t camp here tonight.”
eng	‘You have to love the other people around you just as much as
eng	Some of you are fathers. If your kid asks you for a fish to eat,
eng	will you give him a cheeky snake instead? No, of course not.
eng	Then he said to the people, “Think carefully about this.

eng	straight. She said, “Oh God, you are really good.”

eng	make you real happy. On the day when God will make everyone
eng	alive again, at that time he will pay you properly for that good
eng	thing you did for those poor people.”
eng	After he gets home he will call out to all his friends. He will
eng	say, ‘Hey, I’ve found my lost sheep. We can all be happy

eng	will not give you things for yourself.

eng	didn’t say that for the Pharisee, the man that reckoned he was
eng	real good. He didn’t go home feeling good.
eng	Herod was very happy to see Jesus. You see, a long time before
eng	that day Herod heard about Jesus, so he always wanted to meet
eng	him. He wanted to see Jesus do something powerful.
eng	Jesus asked him, “What things?”

eng	the things they had with each other all the time.
eng	If anyone will not listen to him, that person will not belong to
eng	God’s people, and he will die.’
eng	But Peter and John said to those leaders, “Do you think that
eng	God wants us to listen to you? Or do you think he wants us to
eng	listen to him, and do the things he says? What do you reckon? We
eng	know he wants us to do whatever he says,
eng	As soon as Ananias heard Peter say that he fell down and died. A
eng	lot of people heard about what happened and they were frightened.
eng	The soldiers brought the close followers of Jesus to the Jewish
eng	council men to talk to them. Then the big boss of the Jewish
eng	ceremonies growled at them and said,
eng	God helped Stephen to be good to everybody, and he gave Stephen
eng	the power to do great things to show people that God was great.
eng	That big boss tricked our family and was very hard on them. He
eng	made our mob throw their baby boys into the river to kill them.
eng	So then they made a statue that looked like a baby cow. They
eng	brought money and things to it, and they had a big party to show
eng	respect to the thing they made.
eng	Those men kept hitting Stephen with big stones. Then he called
eng	out, “Jesus, my leader, let my spirit come to be with you
eng	Philip saw him sitting in his wagon and he was reading God’s
eng	book. He was reading the part that God’s man, called Isaiah,
eng	But get up and go into the town. Somebody there will tell you
eng	There were some Jewish people in Jerusalem that talked the Greek
eng	language. Saul told them to believe in Jesus, but they argued
eng	with him. Then they got upset and tried to kill him.
eng	He started feeling hungry and he wanted something to eat, but he
eng	waited and prayed while the people in the house were getting
eng	some food ready. Then Peter had like a dream, but he was still
eng	So right away I sent those men to bring you here. Thank you for
eng	coming. God can see us all here. We are ready to hear everything
eng	that he told you to say to us.”
eng	Then I heard a voice say to me, ‘Get up Peter. Kill some of
eng	those animals and eat them.’
eng	The Jewish leaders told Herod that they were happy for him to
eng	kill James, so Herod told his soldiers to grab Peter too. They
eng	grabbed him at the time for the Jewish people to have their
eng	ceremony where they ate flat damper.
eng	There were some good Christians in the church in the town called
eng	Antioch. They were men that told God’s messages and taught
eng	God’s word to people. They were Barnabas, and Simeon (his
eng	other name was Niger), and Lucius from the land called Cyrene,
eng	and Manaen (he grew up with the big boss called Herod), and Saul.
eng	Listen, friends. Some of you are Jews that belong to our
eng	grand-father Abraham’s family, and some of you are not Jews
eng	but you respect our God. All of you listen to this message that
eng	God sent to us. It is about the way God wants to save us.
eng	So you people be careful. Don’t be like those people that
eng	God’s men wrote about.” That is the message that Paul told
eng	the people in that meeting in Antioch.
eng	But somebody told Paul and Barnabas what they wanted to do, and
eng	then Paul and Barnabas tore their clothes to show them they were
eng	upset, and they ran into the crowd of people. They shouted,
eng	He did the same thing for them that he did for us. They believed
eng	in him and he made them clean from the wrong things they did.

eng	aloud to God and saying that he is really good, and they were
eng	singing songs to God. The other prisoners were listening to them.
eng	The Jews that lived in Berea were happy to listen to the message
eng	about Jesus and they thought about it carefully, not like the
eng	Jews in Thessalonica. The Berea people read God’s book every
eng	day to find out if Paul’s message was true.
eng	1-2 After that Paul left Athens and he went to a town called
eng	After that Apollos said, “I want to go to Achaia country.”
eng	That is the way the message about Jesus got very powerful, and a
eng	lot of people heard that message.
eng	He visited all the Christians in the towns in Macedonia, and he
eng	told them a lot of things to help them be strong for Jesus.
eng	And you know that I told you all of God’s message, everything
eng	that will help you. I didn’t keep anything secret. I taught
eng	you God’s message in places where everyone heard me, and I
eng	taught you in your homes too.
eng	We left Tyre on that ship and went to a town called Ptolemais.
eng	There were Christians in that town too, so we went and said
eng	hello to them, and we stayed with them that night.
eng	That’s what we wrote in our letter.”
eng	The light was so bright that I fell down to the ground. Then I
eng	heard the voice of somebody talking to me from the sky. He said,
eng	‘Saul. Saul. Why are you making trouble for me and hurting
eng	Don’t do what they will ask you to do. There are more than 40
eng	men that will hide beside that road and wait for Paul to come
eng	along, so they can grab him and kill him. They even promised God
eng	that they will not eat or drink anything until they kill Paul.
eng	They are ready right now. They are just waiting for you to agree
eng	If you ask him questions you will find out for yourself that
eng	everything we are telling you is true.”
eng	Then they asked Festus, “Can you tell your soldiers to bring
eng	Paul to Jerusalem right now, and judge him here?” You see,
eng	they were going to secretly hide near the road and wait for Paul
eng	to come along, then jump up and kill him.
eng	So I asked them, ‘What did he do?’ And I found out that he
eng	didn’t do anything bad, so we can’t kill him. But then he
eng	asked me to send him to Rome, for our biggest boss to judge him,
eng	so now I reckon I will send him to Rome.
eng	And Paul said, “I told everyone this message, but some of the
eng	Jewish people didn’t like it, so they grabbed me and they
eng	tried to kill me. They did that in God’s ceremony house.
eng	But after a little while, the wind changed, and a big strong
eng	wind blew across the island from the north side, and it pushed

eng	Jewish leaders to come and talk with him. So they came, and Paul
eng	said to them, “My brothers, I didn’t do anything bad to our
eng	people, and I didn’t say anything bad about our Jewish
eng	culture. But our leaders in Jerusalem grabbed me, and they
eng	started to kill me. Then the boss of the Roman soldiers came and
eng	got me, and made me his prisoner.
eng	He taught them the way that God takes people into his family,
eng	and he taught them all about our leader Jesus Christ. He
eng	wasn’t frightened of anyone, and nobody tried to stop him
eng	They didn’t want the wonderful God that never dies, but
eng	instead they made models of things that do die. They made things
eng	that look like people, or birds, or animals, or snakes or those
eng	kinds of things, and they respected those things. They didn’t
eng	(The next part, 2:17—3:8, mainly talks to Jewish people, so we
eng	have not translated it yet.)
eng	It is like this. We believe in Jesus, so God tells us, “You
eng	are all right now.” But if we only think about that law and
eng	try to do the things it says, God will not tell us that we are
eng	And that’s not all. Jesus Christ bled and died for us, so now
eng	God tells us, “You are all right,” and there is no way that
eng	he will get angry with us or punish us.
eng	Actually you used to do bad things all the time but now you have
eng	made God your boss and you really want to do whatever he wants.
eng	I keep trying to do good things, but I can’t. No, I keep doing
eng	the bad things I don’t want to do.
eng	But don’t worry about the trouble we get now. Later God will
eng	make everything so good for us that we will not even think about
eng	“The message from God is very close to you
eng	Or maybe God gave you the power to cheer people up, well this is
eng	your job. Or maybe he gave you the power to share your money and
eng	things with other people, well he wants you to share it with
eng	people that need things. Or maybe God gave you the power to be a
eng	leader, well you have to try to lead people properly. Or if God
eng	gave you the power to feel sorry for people that have troubles,
eng	and the power to be good to them, well this is his job for you,
eng	so be happy while you do it.
eng	God’s law says, “Love other people just as much as you love
eng	yourself.” You know there are lots of other laws too, like,
eng	“Don’t sleep with people that you are not married to, as if
eng	they are they are your wives or husbands,” and, “Don’t
eng	murder anybody,” and, “Don’t steal anything,” and,
eng	“Don’t think about getting something for yourself if it
eng	belongs to somebody else.” But if you really love other people
eng	you will not do any of these wrong things anyway. So this law,
eng	that says to love people, it says what all the other laws put
eng	So don’t eat any meat, and don’t drink any wine if another
eng	Christian will get upset and go wrong if you do it.
eng	and he picked me out to be a special worker for Jesus Christ. My
eng	job is to tell the good news about Jesus to you mob that are not
eng	Jews. Then God’s spirit works in you to make you good and
eng	right, and God is really happy with you. It is like I give you
eng	to God, like a really good present.
eng	I’m sending this letter to you Christians there in the city
eng	called Corinth. God picked you to be his own special people and
eng	he joined you to Jesus Christ. You are in God’s family now,
eng	along with everyone that says to Jesus, “You are my leader.”
eng	He is their leader, and he is our leader too.
eng	People might reckon that is a stupid thing for God to do, but
eng	God’s way is better than the best idea any human has ever had.
eng	And people might reckon that God is weak. He just let his son
eng	die. But those people are wrong. God did that to show us that he
eng	is stronger than anyone else.
eng	These are the things that we tell you about. We don’t use
eng	words that smart people taught us, but we use the words that
eng	God’s spirit teaches us. And we explain God’s message to
eng	people that have God’s spirit living inside them.
eng	“People reckon they are smart,
eng	You see, some of you reckon you are really great, and you say,
eng	“Paul is frightened to come back here.”
eng	Listen. You know what will happen to bad people, don’t you?
eng	They will not be in God’s family. They will never get the good
eng	things that God will give to his people in heaven. Don’t let
eng	anyone trick you about this. I’ll tell you now about the kind
eng	of people that will not be in God’s family. People that play
eng	around with somebody they are not married to, and sleep with
eng	them, they will not be in God’s family. Or 2 men that sleep
eng	together and do what is wrong, they will not be in God’s

eng	work. You know about soldiers. They don’t have to buy their
eng	own food or their gear. And you know about gardeners. They work,
eng	and they always eat some of the food they grow. And it is the
eng	same for people that look after cows. They work, and they can
eng	drink some of the milk they get. You see, it’s right for
eng	people to work and then get something for it. So, if my work is
eng	to tell you about Jesus, it’s right for you to give me
eng	something for my work. But I never ask you to give me anything.
eng	My friends, do you remember the story about my mob, the Israel
eng	people, a long time ago? They all followed Moses and walked out
eng	into the hot dry country, and God covered them all with a big
eng	cloud, and this cloud showed them where to go. Then they came to
eng	the Red Sea and God pushed the water back so that they all
eng	walked through the Red Sea on dry ground.
eng	Don’t just think about yourself, and what is good for you, but
eng	think about what is good for other people.
eng	It’s like this, God made the first woman by taking a part of
eng	the first man, but after that every man was born from a woman.
eng	But everything really comes from God.
eng	And don’t come to that meeting hungry. If you are hungry, eat
eng	something at home before you come to the meeting, so when you
eng	meet together, you will not do wrong and God will not punish you.
eng	But we don’t need to cover the beautiful parts of our bodies.
eng	God has joined all these parts together to make one body. We
eng	might think some parts are not important, but God has made them
eng	You know, I talked to you already about the special power that
eng	God gives to his people, and now I’m telling you that one day
eng	we will stop using that special power. But we can’t stop
eng	loving people. If you love somebody properly you will always
eng	love them. But the time will come when God will not need to give
eng	us special power any more. When that time comes God will not
eng	tell some people his special messages, and God will not get some
eng	people to talk in special languages, and God will not let some
eng	people know special things.
eng	You see, it is like this. If I pray in a special language, I’m
eng	not using my mind. I’m not thinking about my words while I
eng	pray. Only my spirit is praying.
eng	Maybe you think I’m wrong, but remember this, you don’t know
eng	everything in God’s word. It didn’t start with you, and you
eng	are not the only people that ever heard it.
eng	Listen, this is the true story. Jesus Christ died, and God made
eng	him alive again. Jesus was the first person to die and then come
eng	back to life again, and to live for ever.
eng	Every kind of thing that is alive has a different kind of body
eng	from every other kind of thing. People have one kind of body.
eng	Animals have a different kind of body. Birds have another kind
eng	of body, and fish have another kind of body.
eng	Do it like this. On the 1st day of every week, each of you can
eng	pick out some of the money that you got that week, and keep it
eng	in a separate place. I will come to you soon, and you will have
eng	this money ready for me. You will not have to quickly look
eng	around and try to find it when I get there.
eng	3-4 You see, Titus was there with me, and he is a Greek man, not
eng	a Jew. But there were some Jewish men that came secretly into
eng	the church in Jerusalem. They reckoned they believed in Jesus,
eng	but they didn’t really trust him properly. They only came into
eng	the church to see what we were doing. And they reckoned that
eng	Titus had to follow the Jewish law and have a young man’s
eng	operation. But, you see, if we belong to Jesus Christ we are
eng	free from that law. But those men wanted to force us to keep
eng	So God will be good to everyone that believes him, just like he
eng	was good to Abraham when Abraham believed God.
eng	And when we became God’s kids he sent his son’s spirit to
eng	live right inside us. His spirit in us gets us to call out to
eng	God, “My Dad, you are my father.”
eng	“Be happy, you woman that hasn’t got any kids.
eng	You see, it is like this. We all have a bad part in us that
eng	makes us want to do bad things, to make us feel good. And we
eng	also have God’s spirit in us, and he makes us want to do good
eng	things. These 2 are both in you, and they both want to control
eng	you, so they are fighting each other inside you all the time.
eng	Whenever you listen to God’s spirit and try to do I good
eng	things, that bad part in you tries to stop you, so you don’t
eng	do what you really want to do.
eng	You see, it doesn’t matter whether anyone did a young man’s
eng	operation on you, or not. The most important thing is this. God
eng	changed you into a new person.
eng	I know you heard about what God did. He is very good to you, and
eng	he picked me to tell you his message.
eng	You see, Jesus Christ has been good to us. He has given us each
eng	a spiritual gift. He gives each one of us the spiritual power to
eng	do something properly. He himself picks the one to get each gift.
eng	And don’t swear, or say anything that is bad. But say good
eng	things that will help people, and make them stronger. In this
eng	way your words will be good for those that hear you.
eng	Don’t get drunk. If you drink too much grog you will go wild
eng	and stupid. Don’t do that, but instead, let the Holy Spirit
eng	Now I’m talking to bosses. You have to do the same, you have
eng	to be good to your workers. Don’t say anything to frighten
eng	them. Don’t tell them you want to punish them. Remember that
eng	God in heaven is your boss, and he is the boss of your workers
eng	too. And he treats everyone the same, no matter whether you are
eng	Yes, I love you, just like Jesus Christ loves you, and I want to
eng	be with you again. God himself knows this is true.
eng	3-4 Each of you has to think about what is good for the others.
eng	Don’t only think about what is good for yourself. Don’t
eng	think that you are better than other people, but think that they
eng	are better than you. And don’t do things only to get people to
eng	say you are good. Don’t try to be a boss over other people,
eng	but let others be boss over you.
eng	Yes, you can be happy too, even if they kill me. You can be
eng	And all of us have to think like this if we are spiritually
eng	strong now and live properly for Jesus. But if you think
eng	differently about anything, God will help you and show you which
eng	But right now I have everything I need, and even more than I
eng	need. You gave all these things to Epaphroditus to bring to me,
eng	and I’m happy to get them. But you didn’t only give them to
eng	me. You gave them to God. You gave him the right sort of
eng	present, a really nice one, and it has made him very happy.
eng	But God got Jesus Christ to live in a human body and then die,
eng	so that now you can come back to God and be his friends. God did
eng	this so that later, at the time when God will judge everyone, he
eng	will see that you are properly good and clean inside, and he
eng	will not blame you. He will say that you are not guilty.
eng	They are trying to have a church without Jesus.
eng	And now I am talking to you fathers. Don’t be rough on your
eng	children. Don’t make them get angry with you, or they might
eng	And friends, do you know what happened to the people in the
eng	churches in Judea country? They believed in Jesus and their
eng	Jewish countrymen gave them a lot of trouble. And it is the same
eng	for you now. You believe in Jesus and your countrymen give you a
eng	lot of trouble. That Jewish mob didn’t want to believe God,
eng	and they made trouble for Jesus too.
eng	None of you men can ever sleep with a woman that is not your own
eng	wife. If you do that, you are taking something that belongs to
eng	another man. He is like your brother, but you are doing a bad
eng	thing to him. And God will punish you if you do things like
eng	that. We told you this when we were with you, and we mean it.
eng	They work for God, so respect them and love them very much.
eng	Our Christian friends, we know you are learning to trust God
eng	more and more, and you are loving each other more and more. So
eng	we have to thank God for you all the time.
eng	So then, friends, you have to keep strong and keep on properly
eng	trusting Jesus. Keep on believing the things that we taught you.
eng	You see, Jesus taught us those things, and later we taught them
eng	to you. We told you those things when we were there with you,
eng	and after that we wrote letters to you to tell you more. Keep on
eng	3-4 Do you remember the time that we were in Ephesus, and I got
eng	up to go to Macedonia? At that time I wanted you to straighten
eng	out those people in Ephesus that teach the wrong message, so I
eng	told you to stay there. Those people think a lot about old time
eng	stories that are not true, and they think about the lists of
eng	names of people in their family. Then from there they teach
eng	people lies. People that listen to them just get into useless
eng	arguments. People shouldn’t do that, but they have to learn
eng	about God and the way he works. They have to learn to believe in
eng	God and to do whatever he wants. So I want you to tell those
eng	lying teachers to stop teaching those wrong things.
eng	And in your meetings, I want the women to dress properly and
eng	sensibly. They can’t dress in a way that makes men look at
eng	them. They can’t think about the fancy clothes they will wear,
eng	or their fancy hairdo, or the jewels that they want to wear,
eng	like gold or pearls. Those things are not important.
eng	– They can’t be greedy, wanting lots of money and things.
eng	8-9 You sometimes hear people say, “If we train our bodies we
eng	will get fit to play sport and we will live better lives now,
eng	and that is a little bit good for us. But if we train our
eng	spirits to respect God and take notice of him we will not only
eng	live better lives now but we will live a lot better in the life
eng	that will come after we die, just like God promised us. That is
eng	a lot better for us.” If people tell this message they tell a
eng	true story, and everybody has to follow that word.
eng	God says, “You have to pay the worker for his work.” God
eng	gives us an example of this in his law. We read in God’s book,
eng	“If you get an animal to work for you, you have to let that
eng	animal eat something when it works.” Well, it is like that too
eng	with the church leaders. They work for the church, so the church
eng	has to pay them properly.
eng	All right, Timothy, God gave you his good news, so you have to
eng	look after it properly. Make sure nobody changes it around.
eng	There are some people that have big discussions but say bad
eng	things about God. Don’t listen to them. They might reckon they
eng	know all about it and they might say that you are wrong, but
eng	really, they are the ones that are wrong.
eng	And you are also like a sportsman. You know that sportsmen have
eng	to follow the rules of their sport, otherwise they can’t win.
eng	Well, just like that, you have to follow the rules that God set
eng	down, so that in the end you will win and he will give you the
eng	Most people will only love themselves, and money. They will
eng	think that they are smart and they will tell everyone they are
eng	smart. They will say bad things about other people. They will
eng	never do what their parents tell them to do. They will never
eng	thank anyone for anything. They will not respect things that are
eng	10-12 Almost all my friends went away to somewhere else. Demas
eng	just likes to have fun with the things that are around these
eng	days so he left me and went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to
eng	Galatia country, and Titus went to Dalmatia country. And I told
eng	Tychicus to go to Ephesus. Only Luke is here with me now. If
eng	Mark was here he could help me a lot in my work, so get him and
eng	– don’t pick people that drink a lot of grog,
eng	Then the old women can teach the young women to love their
eng	And Titus, you know the lawyer called Zenas and his mate called
eng	Apollos. Those 2 men will be leaving your place soon to go on a
eng	trip. Please help them as much as you can. Make sure they have
eng	everything they need for their trip.
eng	This is me, Paul, writing this with my own hand so you can be
eng	sure I mean it, I will pay that money back to you. But remember
eng	you already got a lot from me. I told you about Jesus and he
eng	My dear friends, you have to be ready to listen to other people,
eng	and you have to stop and think before you say anything yourself.
eng	Stop and think before you get angry, too.
eng	Maybe you reckon, “Some people can believe in Jesus and other
eng	people can do the good things that Jesus says to do.” I answer
eng	like this, “You can’t show me that you believe in Jesus if
eng	you don’t do the things he says. But whenever I do the good
eng	things he tells me to do I show you that I do believe in him.”
eng	– We are fair to everybody. We don’t treat some people good
eng	and other people like rubbish.
eng	5-6 While you lived here on this earth you killed good people
eng	that couldn’t fight back. You lied and said they were guilty
eng	and then you killed them. While you were doing that you got
eng	everything you wanted and had plenty to eat. You are fat now,
eng	but look out. God will kill you. Think about a farmer and his
eng	cow. He feeds that cow a lot of grass and makes it fat, then he
eng	kills it to get some meat. Well that is a picture of you. You
eng	are fat now, but God will kill you.
eng	You are trusting God and he is saving you, so you are really
eng	happy. You are so happy you can’t properly say how happy you
eng	You see, you already found out that Jesus Christ is really good.
eng	Some of you are working men. You belong to your bosses. Maybe
eng	your boss is good to you, or maybe your boss is rough on you. It
eng	doesn’t matter. You have to listen carefully to your boss
eng	anyway and do whatever he tells you. Sometimes you do nothing
eng	wrong, but your boss makes trouble for you or hits you because
eng	you are following Jesus. You have to respect him anyway and take
eng	it quietly. Don’t try to pay him back.
eng	God has given each one of you a different way to do good for
eng	each other. He has given you the power to do it, so you have to
eng	God loves you and he is looking after you, so tell him about
eng	everything that makes you sad, or angry, or worried, and trust
eng	him to look after you properly.
eng	But while I’m still alive in this body I will do everything I
eng	can to keep telling you these things so that after I die you
eng	will always remember them.
eng	Suppose these people never knew the right way. If that is true,
eng	God will not punish them very much. But that is not true. They
eng	did know the right way and then they turned back and went the
eng	wrong way, so God will really punish them a lot.
eng	God is very good to you, and I pray that he will keep being good
eng	to you more and more. I pray that he will keep feeling sorry for
eng	you, and help you be really happy and quiet inside yourselves.
eng	And I pray that he will keep loving you very much.
eng	He is the only God. He gets our leader, Jesus Christ, to save
eng	us. So everyone has to always thank him and remember how great
eng	he is. He has all power. Everything has to do whatever he says.
eng	He always had this power. He had it right from the start of
eng	time. And he will have all this power for ever. This is true.
eng	'A bit of a shame' because, even though the public finance
eng	situation in the Member States is complicated, we should have
eng	done everything in our power to reinvest the revenue collected
eng	for the benefit of, for example, trans-European transport
eng	network (TEN-T) priority projects.
eng	- The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
eng	A joint statement by the European Parliament and the Council.
eng	'The European Parliament and the Council are mindful of the
eng	importance of providing accurate information to consumers, in
eng	particular, when products are marketed with an indication of
eng	origin so as to protect them against fraudulent, inaccurate or
eng	Above all, EU policy should be measured by the progress made in
eng	improving the well-being of Europeans.
eng	According to future estimates relating to employability and
eng	required diplomas, there are allegedly 15.6 million new jobs
eng	within the EU for graduates and 3.7 million for those with a
eng	secondary education qualification (source: Cedefop). On the
eng	other hand, 12 million jobs are going to be cut for those with a
eng	lower level of qualification!
eng	According to the target set in 2002, EU Member States must offer
eng	early years education to 90% of children between the age of
eng	three and the compulsory school age.
eng	Admittedly, this text is far less ambitious than the initial
eng	proposal, but it will enable us for the first time to implement
eng	the 'polluter pays' principle and to internalise external
eng	transport costs such as noise and CO2 emissions.
eng	After five years, we will know whether it is working and then
eng	this credit rating foundation will also have to pay back the
eng	funds that it has received.
eng	Agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
eng	All of this goes towards underlining the need to protect
eng	European businesses and the fact that there can be no growth and
eng	development, and above all no jobs, in a social and market
eng	economy situation in which the market - which is also a
eng	fundamental instrument of our European Union - does not pursue a
eng	higher and more important goal, namely social policy.
eng	All this must be viewed from the sustainability standpoint you
eng	have been talking about, as well as from the environmental and
eng	social standpoints, but must also be viewed from the other side,
eng	which is also important: that is, the human side, for fishers
eng	who are suffering enormously.
eng	Also of interest is the idea of bringing the timing of the MMF
eng	into line with the political cycles of EU bodies, thereby
eng	increasing democratic control and accountability.
eng	Although it is expected that South Sudan will apply for
eng	accession to the Cotonou Agreement, the 10th European
eng	Development Fund will not be available until sometime after
eng	accession to the agreement.
eng	Although the directive should not allow discrimination based on
eng	the haulier's nationality, Article 7k permits Member States
eng	which introduce a system for charging tolls and/or users of the
eng	infrastructure to offer suitable compensation for these charges,
eng	which may distort competition.
eng	Amendment of Rule 51: joint committee meetings (
eng	An announcement today in that direction would certainly be
eng	helpful for Egypt and for the Egyptians.
eng	And lastly, I find it important to mention the importance of a
eng	deep understanding of cultural heritage, so that communities
eng	living together can recognise and respect each other's cultural
eng	values. I believe that the concrete task of the Commission is to
eng	promote all of these issues, while that of Parliament is to
eng	strengthen theoretical and political support.
eng	Another important element is the strengthening of development
eng	based on small and medium-sized enterprises.
eng	Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort, if not destroy,
eng	Approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units
eng	As I have already explained, all the matters discussed at that
eng	time are linked to national competence.
eng	As a Bulgarian politician, I am following with particular
eng	interest the developments concerning the intermediate category
eng	of beneficiary regions, which is planned to be created in the
eng	new 2013-2020 budget framework.
eng	As a result of the provision on revision the co-legislators can
eng	make informed decisions because the Commission will conduct an
eng	in-depth survey on further compulsory labelling requirements.
eng	As an example, as Mr Audy reminded us, we have already
eng	implemented three concrete simplification measures for FP7: more
eng	use of average personnel costs, easier procedures for
eng	owner-managers of SMEs, and a clearing committee to ensure a
eng	common interpretation of the rules.
eng	As far as the radio spectrum is concerned, our policy must have
eng	realistic yet ambitious objectives so that European companies
eng	are able to compete in the world market on a sounder footing.
eng	As if that were not enough, the rivalries between the tribes and
eng	armed groups in South Sudan are also on the rise, and observers
eng	estimate that more than a thousand people have already lost
eng	their lives since January.
eng	As part of the mechanism for cooperation in the area of nuclear
eng	safety, we are considering a project aimed at helping the most
eng	significantly affected population groups around the Chernobyl
eng	As regards the 2012 budget, I would like to point out that the
eng	draft budget that was adopted by the Commission on 20 April is
eng	in line with the European Council conclusions of 24 and 25
eng	March, which state that fiscal consolidation efforts must be
eng	complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms.
eng	As someone who, for many years, worked as a journalist and has a
eng	thorough knowledge of the job, this matter is of particular
eng	importance to me. In Azerbaijan, journalists are constantly
eng	hindered from fulfilling their basic role - the reliable and
eng	credible provision of information.
eng	As such, the MFF needs to have the financial backing to match
eng	the ambition and commitment of the Europe 2020 strategy.
eng	As the primary role of the IMF is to work on conditional
eng	structural reform packages to accompany the distribution of
eng	funds to members when they are in dire straits, I believe that
eng	Ms Lagarde has shown that she is well able to broker complex
eng	agreements on controversial issues, successfully bringing
eng	together disparate parties to reach a beneficial solution.
eng	As we approach a new stage of EU enlargement, the MFF must
eng	provide for properly balanced expenditure.
eng	As with Mr Lyon's report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo's
eng	report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we
eng	will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget
eng	for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be
eng	a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make
eng	choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ...
eng	Aside from what has already been said about the precautionary
eng	principle and essential traceability - the first point - it is
eng	also a question of knowing how this general alert singling out
eng	Spanish cucumbers for blame could have been issued without any,
eng	At a time when the EU has already understood that greater
eng	coordination of economic policy and greater control of budgetary
eng	policy are both necessary, the idea that the Multiannual
eng	Financial Framework (MFF) should support economic governance
eng	seems an extremely relevant one to me.
eng	At present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from
eng	countries outside the EU, mainly Russia.
eng	At the present time, attention is mainly paid to implementation
eng	of the EU Action Plan for 2009-2012, which is aimed at
eng	strengthening European cooperation in the struggle against the
eng	unacceptable consequences of drug addiction. I would like to see
eng	the Centre working not only on the consequences but also on the
eng	causes of drug addiction, thus solving the problem at an early
eng	stage. I voted in favour.
eng	At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our
eng	job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a
eng	dangerous foodstuff on the market.
eng	At the same time, this method also enables the Member States to
eng	generate resources to reinvest in the transport system in order
eng	to make it more sustainable so as to actually reduce these
eng	At times of crisis, investment is needed in jobs and development.
eng	Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to
eng	the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly
eng	Because of Lisbon, investment treaties can become an instrument
eng	for the Commission's political objectives - and not just the
eng	Commission's: we can be absolutely sure that the Greens will try
eng	to advance their political programme, and we have seen that in
eng	the trade treaties time after time.
eng	Better use can be made of the forest in this fight, not only
eng	through preventing felling, but also through afforestation and
eng	reforestation programmes.
eng	Both sides are also significant investors in each other's
eng	economy, with a combined volume of Foreign Direct Investment
eng	worth EUR 200 billion in 2009.
eng	Businesses in Europe must remain competitive.
eng	But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a
eng	number of issues: first of all, the fact that there are some
eng	diverse standards; secondly, the long time that it takes from
eng	the time of application to actual registration.
eng	By 'European family', I mean the overseas countries and
eng	territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European

eng	Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication

eng	Consensus was also reached on the issue of transparency, since I
eng	support the idea to oblige all registered rating agencies to
eng	conduct an annual review to assess their past credit rating
eng	performances, with this information then being passed on to the
eng	Considering the significant economic returns from such
eng	programmes, I voted in favour of the Remek report which calls on

eng	Does this make us a key international player with influence to
eng	match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding 'No'.
eng	Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in
eng	politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing
eng	expectations of European public opinion.
eng	During the debate, one of our fellow Members said that letting
eng	Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen would be a childish decision.
eng	I totally disagree. I believe that when we become adults, we

eng	For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong
eng	Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action, and many others

eng	For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr
eng	Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must
eng	apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen.
eng	For their part, entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to offer
eng	new quality services, which will stimulate the development of
eng	the common European economy.
eng	For this reason, Member States should ensure that vocational
eng	education and training is better adjusted to the needs of the
eng	labour market, and that vocational education provides employees
eng	with the skills needed to take up new, sustainable jobs that
eng	will be created in the future sustainable economy. I consider
eng	the role of local governments, entrepreneurial partnerships and
eng	educational institutions important in the development of the
eng	labour market demands of vocational education and training.
eng	For us, if the European Union is to progress, it needs to
eng	develop a policy based on principles of peace, detached from
eng	military means and interventions, and to promote the
eng	demilitarisation of international relations.
eng	Fourthly, in addition to all the cultural, social, religious and
eng	foreign policy concerns, the accession of Turkey would place a

eng	Further there will be a prohibition of so called pre-ticked
eng	boxes causing problems especially in the passenger travel sector.
eng	Furthermore, entrepreneurs, managers of small and medium-sized
eng	enterprises in the creative sector, need better access to
eng	financing opportunities, because we currently have too little
eng	know-how and too little access to bank finance.
eng	Furthermore, owing to the European Union's high degree of
eng	dependency on imports from third countries (60%), producers have
eng	very little or even no influence on the price levels of
eng	fisheries products. I agree that the ceiling on de minimis aid
eng	should be raised from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm for a
eng	transitional period of three years, while ensuring that
eng	environmental and social sustainability are not undermined and
eng	that competition between Member States is not distorted.
eng	Furthermore, the way in which this approach penalises the
eng	geographically more peripheral Member States, countries of
eng	origin, departure or destination of goods, for the benefit of
eng	'central' and transit countries, is unacceptable.

eng	However, I regret the shortcomings in the management of the
eng	fixed assets' inventory identified by the Court of Auditors but
eng	note the Agency's assurance that this will be remedied in the
eng	2010 accounts; considers that uncertainty about the location of
eng	fixed assets is another illustration of the problems and
eng	additional costs arising from using two sites.
eng	However, I would like us to establish more precisely what
eng	overall cost savings the Union will achieve as a result of
eng	environmental improvements and to present these figures.
eng	However, as regards trade relations between the European Union
eng	and third countries, there remain profound differences in terms
eng	of social protection systems, as well as of working conditions.
eng	However, for formal reasons, we must ensure that those
eng	businesses which are affected are involved in an appropriate way
eng	and, therefore, we need the time to do this.
eng	However, in order to ensure regional cooperation does not serve
eng	merely as an excuse to delay decisions, we have added a whole
eng	raft of requirements which such cooperation should meet.
eng	However, it is essential to put theory into practice, especially
eng	when it comes to mobilising enough financial resources through
eng	Union support programmes and measures to enable the monitoring
eng	of forests' ecological and phytosanitary state and, wherever
eng	necessary, their reclassification, including reforestation.
eng	However, more needs to be done to make improvements in this area
eng	and it is for this reason that I supported this report.
eng	However, that must be the subject of proper legal proceedings.
eng	However, the debate has only just become public, with the result
eng	that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately
eng	informed. I will be happy to provide assistance with such
eng	discussions or requests for information. I consider the project
eng	to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more
eng	about European development - otherwise there will be more and
eng	However, the report fundamentally emphasises the role of
eng	vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need
eng	to 'create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop
eng	and grow', adding that 'to grow, they need a reduced tax burden
eng	and predictability so they can plan and make investments'. It
eng	also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning
eng	must be geared more closely 'to the needs of the labour market
eng	and allow for entry into and mobility within it'. In other
eng	words, what the report does is put education and training fully
eng	at the beck and call of European capitalism.
eng	However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues,
eng	because in relation to the migration issue, in particular
eng	Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that
eng	one of Europe's major successes is now being called into
eng	question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have

eng	States. I am also calling for the Commission to analyse my
eng	request thoroughly and to understand the concerns of an entire
eng	sector, which must be preserved and developed.
eng	I am in favour of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen
eng	area. A detailed and objective assessment of both countries'
eng	compliance with the Schengen acquis has been completed.
eng	I am sorry if there is a false impression about the Commission's
eng	views on Schengen. I do not think I have spoken about anything
eng	other than Schengen for the last month! I have emphasised how
eng	important Schengen is, what a gift it is to the European Union
eng	and that we must strengthen it and not weaken it.
eng	I am voting for this proposal, given that the report has
eng	achieved a balanced approach between the most important issues
eng	for the organisation and the activities of the European External
eng	Action Service, and for the key areas of security and defence
eng	I am voting in favour of this resolution, which relates to a
eng	chapter of the European commercial policy that should be taken
eng	as a model for negotiations with other countries - including
eng	India, China and Pakistan - which certainly do not guarantee
eng	fair competition, let alone respect for social rights and
eng	environmental standards, as Canada does.
eng	I believe that the example shown by the aerospace industry in
eng	Northern Ireland is a significant one - larger companies
eng	mentoring and helping smaller companies to actually access the
eng	programme - and I would use this opportunity to call upon the
eng	Commissioner to provide us with radical and new ways for small
eng	and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from this very important

eng	Rights. I welcome the adoption of this directive, which
eng	constitutes a step forward in European integration and in the
eng	protection of consumer rights but, at the same time, I regret
eng	that the adoption of a number of articles of the directive
eng	involves taking protection away from many Spanish consumers and
eng	users who are going to find themselves deprived of certain
eng	rights that were already enshrined in Spanish law.
eng	I served four terms as a member of parliament for a region, one
eng	area of which, namely Naoussa, has one of the highest
eng	unemployment rates in the whole of Europe, as a result of the
eng	impact of globalisation of the textile industry.
eng	I still believe that some sort of European Arrest Warrant is a
eng	necessary tool to fight crime and terrorism across the Union,
eng	particularly given the huge free movement of people now moving
eng	between Member States, including - sadly - criminals. I also
eng	believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively
eng	small - but still too many.
eng	I support this report, which calls on the Member States to
eng	ensure that people, at different times of life, have access to
eng	vocational education and training which is tailored to their
eng	needs that will facilitate and improve their participation in
eng	the labour market and in society more generally.
eng	I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and
eng	whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member
eng	States' discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of
eng	the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory
eng	non-execution and optional non-execution.

eng	logic of the market and competition.
eng	I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy towards
eng	2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial
eng	challenges of the future, because it tables proposals that
eng	respond to new challenges like food security, environmental
eng	protection and climate change, whilst simultaneously ensuring
eng	greater territorial balance in Europe's rural areas.
eng	I voted for this report because the committee responsible

eng	of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities

eng	practices by business directories

eng	Undertaking because that recently formed undertaking has

eng	I voted in favour of the draft Council Regulation concerning the
eng	extension of the scope of the regulation of the European
eng	Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border
eng	transport of euro cash between euro area Member States. I voted

eng	to the safety of the personnel responsible for transportation.

eng	law of contract for consumers and businesses which will help to

eng	I voted to give discharge to Eurojust and congratulate the

eng	relevant products/services before commencing a procurement
eng	procedure. I consider this initiative an important practice to
eng	be followed by other agencies. I welcome, in addition, the

eng	to submit an ambitious proposal on the subject of energy

eng	In connection with the evacuation drill which took place during
eng	voting time, today, all explanations of positions adopted at

eng	In fact, I have a lot of faith in that.
eng	In fact, the directives entail a substantial increase in EU
eng	interference in the internal economic affairs of Member States,
eng	which suggests a sharp decline in the latter's influence.
eng	In its most recent report on these matters (February 2011), the
eng	Commission stated that Bulgaria needed to improve further the
eng	way the judiciary, police and other investigative bodies are
eng	structured, managed and cooperate.
eng	In my country and throughout Europe, there are families who
eng	struggle to feed and educate their children and do not even
eng	consider having a computer, never mind high speed broadband.
eng	In my opinion, the area where there is greatest room for
eng	improvement is in public awareness. I think it is inadequate and
eng	irresponsible to inform citizens on a given day about which food
eng	they should not buy or which food looks suspicious.
eng	In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
eng	Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we
eng	need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the
eng	causes and also a better system for informing the general public.
eng	In order to address and resolve this problem, Mrs Reding plans
eng	to issue a communication by the end of the year which will
eng	report on the status of the implementation of the existing
eng	directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising and
eng	on the current opportunities for revising it and which will
eng	provide an evaluation of the situation.
eng	In order to meet citizens' needs, Parliament has proposed to
eng	create, in the context of the Structural Funds, a new category

eng	machinations of a process of which they are the victims. I will
eng	never allow the Commission to attack France. I am voting against
eng	In particular, I would like to stress the necessity of
eng	conducting a review of existing programmes with a cultural
eng	component and of drafting a Green Paper and a communication from
eng	the Commission outlining concrete policies for the role of
eng	culture in the EU's external actions.
eng	In particular, these directives propose to strengthen
eng	surveillance mechanisms in a stringent manner in order to
eng	prevent any more Greek-style financial crises within the Union.
eng	In relation to my report, Baroness Ashton, I would particularly
eng	like you to take note of paragraph 6, which calls for the
eng	drafting of a White Paper with a strategic focus on the European
eng	Union's role in international organisations through to 2020.
eng	In spite of the restrictions and bans which have been
eng	introduced, much illegal fishing goes on, or even fishing that
eng	can be considered pillaging.
eng	In the Commission communication to the European Parliament and
eng	the Council entitled 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a
eng	changing world' (COM(2009) 433 final), it is acknowledged that
eng	'GDP has also come to be regarded as a proxy indicator for
eng	overall societal development and progress in general' but 'does
eng	not measure environmental sustainability or social inclusion'.
eng	In a world in which people's quality of life is increasingly
eng	measured using other, non-economic factors, various
eng	international institutions, like the United Nations (UN), the
eng	World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
eng	Development (OECD), are currently studying the definition of new
eng	indicators, so as to measure and analyse economic and social
eng	In the case of Belarus, it is not possible to fulfil this aim in
eng	its entirety due to the measures adopted.
eng	In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should
eng	be able to consider issues freely and make decisions
eng	independently. I would now like to state that we
eng	parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of. If we conduct a
eng	national comparison, we will see that there are only a few
eng	Member States of the European Union who have already established
eng	a transparency register at this level.
eng	In the last section, I then propose that we in Parliament create
eng	an autonomous impact assessment structure.
eng	In the near future, there will be other power stations in other
eng	Member States which will need to be halted because they are
eng	reaching the end of their operational life.
eng	In the same connection, it is natural that the reform and
eng	harmonisation of product labelling should be assessed overall,
eng	In this case, it seems that things went wrong.
eng	In this context, the Commission will examine measures to reduce
eng	excessive dependence on external ratings, improve transparency,
eng	promote competition, introduce the principle of liability and
eng	reduce the risk of potential conflicts of interest due to the
eng	issuer-pays payment model.
eng	In this regard, it should be said that the European Arrest
eng	Warrant responds to a need, particularly in view of the fact
eng	that it is not only honest citizens who mostly take advantage of
eng	the freedom to move around the European Union, but also
eng	criminals, who do not by any means exercise their rights for
eng	tourism or business purposes, but for criminal activities, or to
eng	avoid being brought to justice in their own country or in the
eng	country in which they committed the crime.
eng	In this respect, it will be essential to achieve the full
eng	engagement of public and local authorities. A fundamental
eng	objective of innovation is to maintain a high level of
eng	prosperity in Europe. I hope the joining of forces which has
eng	been proposed will contribute to support for the process of
eng	innovation and help bring about economic stabilisation.
eng	In this way, we can also contribute - thanks to the technologies
eng	and the agricultural techniques that will be used by farmers -
eng	not only to ensuring economic competitiveness, but also to
eng	reducing the impact of agricultural activity on climate change.
eng	In view of the fact that CO2 emissions know no borders, and that
eng	after production is transferred emissions will continue, which
eng	will unavoidably have a negative impact on the environment, the
eng	European Union economy will lose out, since it is exporting jobs.
eng	In view of this, I voted in favour of this report, as it will
eng	allow the Member States, if they so wish, to also charge road
eng	users for some limited external costs, with the aim of
eng	introducing the 'polluter pays' principle to road transport.
eng	Indeed, I want to ask Mr Piebalgs in his reply to explain what
eng	the EU is doing to combat continuing and deteriorating human
eng	rights violations, in particular, concerning human rights
eng	defenders such as Hawa Abdulla from the AU-UN peace-keeping
eng	mission, who has been subject to arbitrary detention and beaten.
eng	Indeed, the conclusions of the scientific opinion given by the
eng	European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) at the end of 2007 are
eng	based on data concerning the slaughter of animals in abattoirs
eng	and which are not reliable with regard to seal hunting.
eng	Information and communications technology (ICT) is important in
eng	all innovative activity. ICT skills depend on improvements in
eng	the quality of training, support for lifelong learning, and the
eng	opportunity for those already in employment to update their own
eng	knowledge and skills continuously.
eng	Instead of lengthening the pain and piling even more burdens on
eng	the Greek economy, it would be far better to accept the
eng	inevitable and the judgment of the markets.
eng	Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure: see Minutes
eng	Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect
eng	nothing more of Russia's democratisation? I believe that as
eng	Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something;
eng	for example, fair elections - there must be progress there.
eng	It also criticises any attempt to cut the funding of the DCI and
eng	the European Development Fund, and stresses once again that not
eng	enough progress has been made with the Millennium Development
eng	Goals (MDG) and that there is a need to increase Official
eng	Development Assistance (ODA).
eng	It believes this measure to be long overdue, and that
eng	budgetisation of the EDF should take place at the earliest
eng	It discusses funding for Roma communities, a subject that my
eng	political party has always opposed, and the allocation of large
eng	amounts of funding for a new round of enlargement of the
eng	European Union in the direction of the Western Balkans, another
eng	point with which I do not agree.
eng	It goes without saying that the constitution of every Member
eng	State should reflect and comply with the European values of
eng	freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, human dignity and
eng	respect of human rights, including the rights of persons
eng	belonging to minorities, without discrimination, as laid down in
eng	It has not been possible to achieve this ambitious goal. I hope
eng	that the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy will be met, in
eng	particular, the EU's commitment to invest 3% of gross domestic
eng	product (GDP) in research and development by 2020.

eng	directive will end the situation in Estonia in which vehicles
eng	from other countries do not pay the tax in Estonia, but our
eng	vehicles pay in other countries.
eng	It is also essential in increasing competitiveness as the EU
eng	overcomes the economic crisis.
eng	It is also vital for governments to be able to undertake
eng	stimulus spending, as the Labour government did in 2008/2009, to
eng	prevent this crisis from turning into a global depression.
eng	It is both mandatory and normal practice in Germany for a legal
eng	entity to register its address in an online directory when it is

eng	furnish the European Union with the tools to compete with and
eng	face its main trade partners, such as the United States, Canada,
eng	China and Japan, on the globalised market.
eng	It is essential to give young Europeans the tools necessary for
eng	them to be able to compete in a globalised world and for them to
eng	be able to enter the labour market using their knowledge and
eng	It is good that the submitted directive emphasises better
eng	quality supervision and controls, but especially the greater
eng	transparency of these processes and public participation.
eng	It is important that this agreement be adopted, as Croatia is
eng	one of the main transit routes through which illicit drugs are
eng	smuggled into the EU, so it is vital that this country be
eng	involved in the EMCDDA's work as soon as possible, particularly
eng	bearing in mind that Croatia's accession to the EU is envisaged
eng	for the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013.
eng	It is impossible to accept that MEPs will not be subject to
eng	public scrutiny regarding the interests they defend in their
eng	role, or the pressure they are subject to or who is putting them
eng	under pressure. I therefore very much welcome the introduction
eng	of the common register of lobbyists and lobbying organisations.
eng	It is more difficult but more beneficial for the people of
eng	Europe to make progress in this area.
eng	It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic
eng	activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic
eng	product (GDP) and that is just the start.
eng	It is not surprising that the report should conclude that a
eng	single European solution is not possible.
eng	It is only after this that we review the Schengen system and
eng	look at how it can be adjusted or improved, because we can see
eng	that there are indeed problems with it, but let us stick to this
eng	It is quite simply necessary to have these bilateral agreements,
eng	and therefore I welcome them.
eng	It is the case that, in waiting for the implementation of a
eng	genuine common diplomacy and a genuine European defence policy,
eng	European soft power and its cultural diplomacy are some of the
eng	few means of influence at our disposal.
eng	It is therefore extremely important that the checking and
eng	assessment of the European reactors does not become a paper
eng	tiger, but that it really is a proper assessment.
eng	It is these citizens and their well-being that should be the
eng	main focus of democratisation, political pluralism, and respect
eng	for human rights and for religious, cultural and ethnic
eng	diversity in both South and North Sudan.
eng	It is unacceptable that, in the face of the extremely severe
eng	crisis affecting the most vulnerable economies in the EU, they
eng	are continuing to make unsupportable cofinancing demands for the
eng	use of Union funds, specifically the Structural Funds.
eng	It is vital that the international community maintains its
eng	presence and a very high level of humanitarian involvement.
eng	It is, however, not at all obvious that with an additional own
eng	resource that would reduce the dependence on GNI, we can expect

eng	value, it must be sensibly managed and it must support public

eng	It should be a key element of public policy in such areas as the
eng	environment, water, energy, transport, telecommunications,
eng	It should not be limited to the elimination of tariff or
eng	non-tariff barriers but should represent an opportunity to take
eng	a qualitative leap in the elimination of environmental and
eng	health policy differences, and I refer, in particular, to the
eng	farming sector, the protection of animal species at risk of
eng	extinction and particular economic extractive activities that
eng	have a significant environmental impact, such as asbestos mining
eng	and oil sands drilling, or that restrict access to medicines for

eng	opportunities by long-liners, which led to a reduction in this
eng	segment in the current report.
eng	It will be a comprehensive programme of technical assistance
eng	focused on growth and jobs, but with an emergency character
eng	because - I repeat - Greece is living in an emergency situation.
eng	It would appear that this text also allows the right to abortion
eng	in Hungary to be restricted by stating, and I quote, 'that the
eng	life of the foetus will be protected from the time of
eng	conception'. The Hungarian Government has backed up its words by
eng	action in this area by launching an anti-abortion communication
eng	campaign which would still, apparently, appear to be using funds
eng	from the European PROGRESS programme (Community Programme for
eng	Employment and Social Solidarity).
eng	Its accession to the World Trade Organisation will create
eng	numerous opportunities in economic relations between the
eng	European Union and Russia.
eng	Just as we did with dairy products when a deep crisis broke out
eng	in that sector, we need now, too, to call that surplus into use.
eng	Ladies and gentlemen, if we understand innovation simply in
eng	terms of new products, processes and services that result in an
eng	increase in economic activity, it is essential that we equip
eng	ourselves with the instruments to measure our innovation
eng	capacity precisely in economic terms and that we do so on the
eng	basis of parameters, such as private investment and R&D,
eng	employment or the number of innovative companies.
eng	Last week in Ireland, forest fires - on a scale not seen for a
eng	long time - caused severe destruction on lands in Donegal, Sligo
eng	and other regions of the country.
eng	Lastly, I should like to voice my support for two powerful ideas
eng	upheld by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian
eng	Democrats): the power conferred on the European Commission to
eng	adopt delegated acts should be reviewed every five years, and a
eng	verification clause should be introduced - the verification
eng	clause being the second powerful idea in this regulation.
eng	Launched in Budapest on 29 April, Youth at Work will bring
eng	together small and medium-sized enterprises and young job
eng	seekers and will provide information and support to inspire

eng	Let me explain briefly: through the use of origin marking,
eng	buyers will be sure they are buying a textile product that is

eng	regulation which, at the cost of significant sacrifices,
eng	European institutions have imposed on all industries in this
eng	Let us also follow up on this by truly taking the steps that the
eng	knowledge provided by this measure makes possible.
eng	Let us not, therefore, ignore this reality that investment is
eng	urgently needed: all the more so if the shameful and
eng	obscurantist intervention plan drawn up by the International
eng	Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and
eng	European Commission is implemented.
eng	Like the rapporteur, I support the Commission's Action Plan for
eng	the development of EGNOS and Galileo, which is based on nine
eng	horizontal measures with an immediate transport application.
eng	Madam President, Commissioner, I am delighted that, in advance
eng	of the next General Assembly of the International Labour
eng	Organisation (ILO), we can debate this welcome initiative of the
eng	ILO proposing to the Member States of this organisation a
eng	convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers.
eng	Madam President, I should like to thank the Presidency of
eng	Parliament for having allowed this debate to take place, as it
eng	was not on the agenda initially.
eng	Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand
eng	from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission
eng	is obviously taking notice of this subject. I also conclude that
eng	it is being handled with too much restraint.
eng	Madam President, for South Sudan, the 9 July date goes before
eng	everything else; for North Sudan, although the comprehensive
eng	peace agreement may be coming to an end, its obligations do not.
eng	Madam President, on 9 July, South Sudan will declare
eng	independence as an English-speaking new African state.
eng	Madam President, the regulation on transitional arrangements for

eng	talk about own resources.
eng	Many points in the submitted reports go in the right direction,
eng	but at the same time they have a number of deficiencies.
eng	Member States must also cooperate with partner countries to
eng	ensure the protection of vulnerable groups and to fight gender
eng	discrimination as well as discrimination on grounds of
eng	ethnicity, religion, age and disability. I hope that the
eng	Commission will come forward with some concrete proposals which
eng	will bring about improved labour and social standards, as well
eng	as proposals to promote corporate social responsibility in its
eng	Minimum standards have therefore now been established, as

eng	expressed its support for the idea of a democratic process which
eng	Moreover, it fails to mention the social reasons that lead to
eng	early school drop-out, to a lack of access to higher education
eng	opportunities and to youth unemployment, just so as to mask the
eng	responsibility of the neoliberal policies promoted by large
eng	companies and financial institutions.
eng	Moreover, there is already an example of good practice: our
eng	presence in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). There is,
eng	therefore, an urgent need for the EU to be represented with a
eng	single voice in the various international bodies. I think that

eng	report, could be a good 'beginning of the end' for this bizarre
eng	Mr Albertini, I am happy to stand anywhere as long as it is

eng	Social Affairs has set out its priorities in the light of an
eng	alarming fact: the economic, financial and social crisis is
eng	continuing to wreak havoc, with 23 million people currently
eng	unemployed, including 5.2 million young people.
eng	Mr President, I had understood that a question was being asked,
eng	but one was not put to me. What I would like to say is that I
eng	still feel it is wrong that we can put in the same boat, on an
eng	equal footing, democracies such as the United States or EU
eng	Member States, and countries and societies where power is
eng	exercised in an authoritarian and totalitarian manner, with
eng	ordinary citizens suffering excessive abuses.
eng	Mr President, I wish to support this resolution on human rights
eng	violations and war crimes committed in Sri Lanka.
eng	Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt asked the Commission to rewrite the
eng	communication but I wonder if, before it is rewritten, we could
eng	get a clear answer today as to whether or not you are aiming to
eng	improve the current existing system, to temporarily close
eng	borders, or to add something to the existing system.
eng	Mr President, developments in Azerbaijan regarding democracy and
eng	human rights continue to be a matter of serious concern to all
eng	of us. Over the last few years, we have noted a worrying trend
eng	of increasing restrictions in this domain.
eng	Mr President, in recent years, academic and political focus on
eng	culture and education has increased dramatically, with analysis
eng	consistently highlighting these areas to be crucial not only in
eng	encouraging economic growth and social cohesion, but also in
eng	facilitating mobility for young people across Europe.
eng	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eurovignette and the
eng	results of the negotiations represent an example of how the
eng	Council is currently attempting to place limitations on and
eng	water down all Parliament's proposals, particularly in the field

eng	Mr President, the explosion at Chernobyl was a disaster, but let
eng	us keep it in perspective: 64 people were killed by Chernobyl
eng	radiation over 23 years, and it caused an unknown proportion of

eng	Mr President, these are just a few of the topics on which work

eng	My home city of Gdańsk is in a small group leading the Polish
eng	contest, which will be decided this month. I am a keen supporter

eng	languages of the EU are French, English and German.
eng	Negative ratings in the face of financial difficulties send a
eng	country into a kind of debt spiral, because a falling rating

eng	Nevertheless, the Commission considers that the current ILO
eng	initiative is a good opportunity to reflect on the situation of

eng	Nineteen weeks later, the Irish banks collapsed and taxpayers

eng	Nonetheless, much more can be done to help European SMEs,
eng	specifically: the swift implementation by the Member States of
eng	the Late Payments Directive; better Commission mechanisms for
eng	encouraging the Member States to apply the principles of the
eng	SBA; adoption by the Member States, without delay, of the last
eng	remaining proposal on the European Private Company Statute; the
eng	regular application by the Commission and the Member States of
eng	the SME test as part of impact assessments; the urgently needed
eng	reduction of the bureaucratic and administrative burden on SMEs;
eng	and putting 'Erasmus for young entrepreneurs' on a permanent
eng	footing, with a sufficient budget.
eng	Not only does the regional government find itself unable to pay
eng	the wages of 76 000 employees, but it still owes roughly EUR 2
eng	billion to its various suppliers.
eng	Now the Member States have two years to implement the new
eng	directive. I would like to call for this timeframe to be
eng	shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would
eng	not present a significant problem.
eng	Nuclear accidents occur without warning and unexpectedly.
eng	Of course, all such trials by the US authorities - which, after
eng	all, is a country that is a democracy and shares our common
eng	values - must nevertheless be conducted fairly with all legal
eng	safeguards of due process, and ideally by civilian courts.
eng	Of course, we must not forget and we cannot ignore various
eng	important issues, which continue to hinder the development of
eng	valuable relations between the EU and Russia, and especially,
eng	moreover, the fact that nearly three years after the war in
eng	Georgia, Russia continues to occupy a large part of the
eng	sovereign territory of Georgia, continues to ignore the
eng	agreement concluded in 2008, and fails to ensure proper access
eng	to these territories by the European Union Observer Mission.
eng	On 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council, meeting in
eng	Lisbon, set the European Union an objective: to become, by 2010,
eng	the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world.
eng	On that occasion, the Council endorsed the Presidency's
eng	conclusions on the progress made and the need to continue to
eng	work in close cooperation with all Member States towards a
eng	solution acceptable to all parties involved.
eng	On the issue of compensation, this will be discussed this
eng	afternoon in the AGRI Council, and I am sure that my colleague,
eng	Commissioner Cioloş, is doing his utmost to identify and
eng	develop ways and means of compensating our farmers who have been
eng	suffering as a result of this problem.
eng	On the other hand, a prior full assessment of the impact of the
eng	measures proposed has not been conducted by the Commission. I
eng	think that it would have had a major impact, in particular, on
eng	Pakistan's population and this country's budget resources.
eng	On the other hand, we know that there are exceptions where
eng	Once again, I voted in favour of this report which points out
eng	that real savings could be made if Parliament only had one
eng	workplace, in the same city as the European Union's other
eng	institutions (in other words Brussels). The report of the
eng	Secretary-General on Parliament's preliminary draft estimates
eng	for 2011 itself draws attention to the huge annual costs arising
eng	from the geographical split of Parliament, estimated at some EUR
eng	160 000 000, which accounts for 9% of Parliament's total budget.

eng	One very important point is that the partnership principle must

eng	successful, firstly, in ensuring that the Commission's powers
eng	are fully respected and, secondly, in stating that legal
eng	certainty should be guaranteed.

eng	which, let us not forget, threaten the very existence of mankind
eng	Overall, I believe that the legislative package which has been
eng	presented is an appropriate response to the global crisis and
eng	the EU's current economic situation, building on the relevant
eng	legislation and complying with the Europe 2020 strategy and
eng	other strategic EU documents, and therefore I recommend adopting
eng	it in the amended version.
eng	Parliament has been asked to waive the parliamentary immunity of
eng	our fellow Member, Mr Severin, as a result of criminal
eng	proceedings in which he is accused of defamation under the

eng	Parliament specifically welcomes the Agency as a reliable
eng	provider of independent and assured environmental information
eng	for all Union institutions, the Member States and policy-making
eng	Particular focus should be directed towards the formulation of
eng	regulation which ensures greater spectrum efficiency, better
eng	frequency planning and safeguards against anti-competitive
eng	behaviour and the taking of anti-social measures with regards to
eng	the usage of the spectrum.
eng	Perhaps it would still be possible to change this during the
eng	process of reaching a parliamentary decision by the end of June.
eng	Point four: Russia is the neighbour of our neighbours, and I
eng	think Nizhny Novgorod would be an excellent opportunity to refer
eng	to the recently adopted ENP review document and, with reference
eng	to this document, to make sure that we are transparent in our
eng	policy vis-à-vis the neighbours we share with Russia.
eng	President I fear that these concerns have been exacerbated for
eng	political ends by certain factions here and elsewhere in Europe
eng	and I wish to make a clear stance regarding our future energy
eng	mix that is free from fear and panic and approaches the subject
eng	of nuclear energy based on science and evidence. I would like to
eng	thank the rapporteur and my friend and colleague Ms Edit Herczog
eng	for all their efforts on this.

eng	force in a worse position than that of the host country, it also
eng	contributes to social dumping.
eng	Recycling, air emissions, climate change, sustainable
eng	consumption and production must be monitored continuously in
eng	order to achieve progress in these areas across the whole of
eng	Europe. A system for preparing environmental economic accounts
eng	is one of the measures that would aid the collection and
eng	compilation of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes
eng	applicable to various economic sectors and macro-economic
eng	material flow accounting.
eng	Registered entities will also have to declare their sources of
eng	income and interests, as well as legislative proposals submitted.

eng	States of the EU. This is a joint achievement of the Member
eng	States, the Commission and Council, but also of the European
eng	Rigour in terms of information means there is a need for equal
eng	rigour in accounting. I hope the monitoring centre will not
eng	desist from truly and accurately carrying out the mission
eng	entrusted to it, and that it will do so whilst managing its
eng	budget the best it can. I also hope that any information it
eng	gathers will help the Member States to follow closely the causes
eng	and consequences of this scourge, and to point to paths and
eng	solutions enabling affected Europeans to free themselves from
eng	the addiction destroying them and their families.
eng	Sarajevo occupies a very important place in Europeans'
eng	historical consciousness. I support awarding the title of
eng	European Capital of Culture exceptionally to the city in 2014.
eng	Secondly, I would like to highlight the need for greater
eng	emphasis to be placed on thematic areas crucial for the future
eng	of Europe, such as energy security, the environment and health
eng	Secondly, regarding Cathy Ashton, she is not only Vice-President
eng	of the Commission, but also High Representative of the Union for
eng	Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
eng	Secondly, we have had very good cooperation between the
eng	Commission, the ECB and the IMF, which was not self-evident when

eng	Since the 'Rose Revolution', the Georgian Government has
eng	consistently implemented democratic reforms, modernising its
eng	country and carrying out difficult, unpopular economic and

eng	Since we cannot just wish it out of existence, we need to deal

eng	rewriting of the communication and specifically of the sentence
eng	which states that a new mechanism shall be introduced for the
eng	reintroduction of border checks.
eng	Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in
eng	plenary may now alter this compromise and balance, and I call on
eng	my fellow Members, and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs
eng	in particular, to come up with a balanced measure that is
eng	South Sudan will be one of the poorest countries on earth, and
eng	if we want the Millennium Development Goals to also take effect
eng	here, it is urgently necessary that the funding made available

eng	Statistics show that around one in three young Europeans has
eng	tried an illicit drug and at least one of our citizens dies
eng	every hour from a drug overdose.
eng	Such a requirement does not conform with the principles of
eng	positive trade relations.
eng	Sure, Member States often lack the political will to act in a
eng	unified and decisive way, and they do not want to see you
eng	strong, but believe me, Baroness Ashton, they will not support
eng	you and will not save your life as High Representative.
eng	Taking this lack into account, it's imperative to improve the
eng	governance system for the EU2020 Strategy, with greater
eng	integration of stakeholders at all stages.
eng	Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has gained additional
eng	powers and corresponding responsibilities, and must now monitor
eng	the conduct of negotiations and the conclusion of air agreements
eng	That is a slippery slope that could result in serious imbalances
eng	and, hence, unfair treatment of the poorest countries.
eng	That is simply unsellable to taxpayers around Europe and it does
eng	not enhance the credibility of the EU institutions.
eng	That is what makes European territorial cooperation the
eng	embodiment of European integration and an extraordinary source
eng	That is why creating an optional instrument that will operate as

eng	large portions of sovereignty over foreign policy to EU bodies,
eng	which would be charged with reaching a common position to be
eng	presented in the international community and in all multilateral
eng	forums. I cannot agree with this prospect: the Member States

eng	some of its suggestions addressed to the European Parliament
eng	through the Smart Regulation Communication, but we also know
eng	about the few highly problematic proposals.
eng	The Commission has not identified any infringements to date.
eng	The Commission is recommending the adoption of many documents
eng	relating to migration in May and June. I would like to express
eng	the hope that, in formulating these documents, the Commission
eng	will maintain a measure of detachment and a cool head.
eng	The Commission representatives on the governing boards of
eng	agencies take the need for quantitative and qualitative
eng	performance criteria very seriously and make every effort to
eng	ensure that they are applied.
eng	The Commission will present its proposals for the next
eng	multiannual financial framework at the end of June.
eng	The Commissioner told Parliament's committee one month ago, when
eng	Mr Cadec put this question to her, that she was not mindful to

eng	The Council and Commission have noted that Japan's capacity to

eng	The Court of Auditors Annual Report for 2009 found the highest
eng	error rate to be in payments under the EU's cohesion policy.
eng	The EIB intended to supplement the loans for medium-sized
eng	businesses with EUR 1 billion a year. I would like to ask the
eng	Commission at what stage of implementation this programme is at,
eng	whether it intends to top up the funding, and whether these
eng	funds are distributed equally to all Member States.
eng	The EU decided to set up its own global navigation satellite
eng	system for two key reasons: firstly, Europe's independence from
eng	other global navigation systems and autonomy, and secondly, to
eng	gain a share in this fast growing worldwide high-tech market,
eng	which today, to a large extent, is dominated by the US. Indirect
eng	benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60
eng	billion per year (including the downstream and upstream market
eng	and public benefits). GNSS is seen as a disruptive technology,
eng	with high potential to create innovations, build up a high-tech
eng	knowledge base and increase productivity in many sectors.
eng	The EU is, in fact, the only trading block that does not provide
eng	direct funding to its GNSS programme.
eng	The EU's EGNOS and Galileo projects can contribute to
eng	competitiveness in every area of this sector of services,

eng	The report calls on Member States to exchange good practices
eng	regarding their vocational education system and training systems
eng	combined with work experience, which should be extended in many
eng	Member States, particularly in France.
eng	The report is balanced because it focuses on animal welfare, the
eng	problems of antibiotic resistance and cost-effectiveness as far

eng	The report seeks to correct the vulnerabilities of national
eng	economies by increasing - excessively in my view - the authority

eng	The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test

eng	opportunities for their products and services.
eng	The talk in our media is about rescuing Greece, giving

eng	The third point is that Europe cannot be founded on values of

eng	acquis without also developing the protection of wages, the
eng	protection of working hours, the protection of health, knowledge
eng	of the demands of domestic work, and without providing domestic
eng	workers with a certain number of guarantees. I wish to sound a
eng	word of warning, which is that this should not lead to the
eng	integration of workers that are in a totally illegal situation.
eng	The trend towards suburbanisation, the concentration of

eng	devise internal credit risk assessments for their own regulatory
eng	capital requirements. I see the need to increase supervisors'
eng	responsibilities, capacity, powers and resources for monitoring,
eng	assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models and
eng	for imposing prudential measures. I believe that credit ratings
eng	must serve the purpose of increasing information to the market
eng	in a manner that provides investors with a consistent assessment
eng	of credit risk across sectors and countries, and consider it
eng	important to enable users to better scrutinise CRAs.

eng	Unfortunately, I would say that the Europe 2020 strategy's
eng	ambitions are not visibly in harmony with the reality of budget
eng	restrictions, which have substantially cut funding for the main
eng	EU programmes in the area of education. I welcome the measures
eng	adopted by the Commission aimed at facilitating accessibility,
eng	transparency and comparability for the purposes of the
eng	recognition process within and among education systems.
eng	Unfortunately, the answer is no, but an increasing number of
eng	targeted programmes have been set up to improve the situation,
eng	including, for instance, the Danube strategy.
eng	Until now, it has seemed as if European contract law was
eng	something unnecessary and the general principle applies that if
eng	a provision is not necessary, then it should be omitted. I also
eng	believe that this report is a diversionary tactic, designed to

eng	Vocational education and training should create the conditions
eng	conducive to labour mobility, both during initial studies and as

eng	We agree, in this vein, with the importance of more widespread
eng	information for investors and that market participants should
eng	only be authorised to invest in derivative financial instruments
eng	if they can prove to have an understanding and ability to assess
eng	the credit risk that the product carries.
eng	We also believe, particularly in view of the current economic
eng	situation, that Parliament must review its expenditure and
eng	identify savings and ways to increase efficiency.
eng	We also need to promote the 25% reduction of administrative
eng	burden indicated in the SBA, which would contribute to the
eng	effectiveness of the SBA, would counteract any protectionist
eng	economic policies of Member States and stimulate business across
eng	the EU. Member States must swiftly implement the revised Late
eng	Payments Directive to effectively combat late payments and their
eng	negative impact, particularly on SMEs.
eng	We are all concerned about the effects of climate change,
eng	environmental conservation and various issues relating to health
eng	and social well-being, which are inseparable from the rational
eng	use of transport. I agree that applying the 'polluter pays'
eng	principle, as well as trying to safeguard the public interest,
eng	results, and must result, in measures primarily aimed at
eng	reducing environmental pollution, noise pollution, damage to the
eng	countryside, and social costs that arise due to poor health,

eng	We must approach this debate without extolling virtues -
eng	Baroness Ashton has rightly highlighted some positive elements;
eng	I would emphasise the good or, rather, the better provision of
eng	information between Parliament and the European External Action
eng	Service - yet also without concealing defects, and a voice as
eng	sensible as that of Giorgio Napolitano, our former fellow Member
eng	and President of the Italian Republic, has reminded us of this
eng	We must ensure that through our young people, these identities
eng	are truly European and not allow the only educational model for

eng	recorded in a file contributes to making cohesion projects
eng	We must still make sure that we have the resources to implement
eng	this protection and information in all the Member States and to
eng	take action against offenders.
eng	We need a democratic regime there and we at the European Union
eng	must do our best to establish that because, without that,
eng	We need the closest possible harmonisation between the Member
eng	States so that, ultimately, we have a harmonised, modern policy
eng	which is up to the job, as the times demand.
eng	We need to find viable solutions for the public finances of
eng	Athens, Dublin and Lisbon.
eng	We need to rebuild the trust in, and value of, this tool and
eng	reserve it for only the most serious of crimes, whilst
eng	guaranteeing and maintaining the highest of standards in its use.
eng	We now have an opportunity to work with a broader perspective.

eng	not been made compulsory, especially as it is a de facto

eng	budgetary means allocated each year to research, they should
eng	establish a percentage of their budget as a minimum threshold
eng	which must be used on research and development-type projects.
eng	We should therefore hold agencies accountable for the
eng	effectiveness of their work, but we should remember that the
eng	results of this work may now have an incredible impact on the
eng	labour market, by linking all vocational training to jobs and
eng	professions which are already showing signs of being in short
eng	supply in the future European Union.
eng	We therefore chose to support paragraph 5, which calls for
eng	greater transparency with regard to Members' expenditure
eng	We think this is very important because one of the things I
eng	consider essential in relation to innovation is that we should
eng	have a 'living document': in other words, that we will have the
eng	opportunity on a regular basis - in Parliament, internationally
eng	at the Innovation Convention, and also at Heads of State or
eng	Government level - to monitor progress and to insist, where the
eng	progress is slow, on speeding it up. That is very important if
eng	this initiative is going to be successful, to create the kind of
eng	jobs we want and to deliver what we expect it to deliver at the
eng	We want to have genuine own resources, as described in the

eng	We wish to say specifically to Mrs Liotard that, as regards the
eng	internal Council document you quoted, the Member States were
eng	aware of it and naturally the Council was aware of it, and even
eng	discussed it. It helped in establishing our position.
eng	We, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian
eng	Democrats) have the courage to push through such a set of rules.
eng	What action does the Commission plan to take in order to include
eng	the subject of gender equality in European climate change policy?
eng	What is advancing faster than anticipated last year is the
eng	creation of the European Emergency Response Centre. I can assure
eng	you it would make a big difference because it would allow us to
eng	accelerate work on scenario planning - what kinds of disasters
eng	we have to be prepared for, and also on modelisation of the
eng	committed Member States' assets.
eng	What is the situation when it comes to the judicial reform and
eng	anti-corruption measures that are still needed? Those citizens
eng	of Romania and Bulgaria who travel to Schengen countries with
eng	good intentions will, in any case - and I am convinced of this -
eng	understand that the inconvenience of border controls is
eng	outweighed by the necessity of protecting all other Europeans
eng	against organised crime and mass illegal immigration.
eng	What underlies these reasons? Objective fears or prejudice,
eng	situational prudence or disappointment? I hope that the interior
eng	and justice ministers will be at least just as frank with each
eng	other as we have been during the process of drafting the Coelho
eng	Whatever people in this Chamber, or anyone else in the European
eng	Union, think about our common foreign and security policy, this

eng	that has real trust and respect from our foreign partners.
eng	When it comes to food, we need transparency and clear
eng	traceability with regard to manufacture.
eng	When there is talk of increases, then discussions must lead to a
eng	consideration of the correct use of resources.
eng	Where necessary, we can make recommendations in this area, if we
eng	need to be more specific later in the process.
eng	While acknowledging the due responsibility shown by the
eng	Commission in the allocations planned for 2012, in my capacity
eng	as rapporteur on the budget for the Committee on Women's Rights
eng	and Gender Equality, I regret the minimal increase in programmes
eng	such as PROGRESS, which is responsible for implementing
eng	important initiatives for young people, for the fight against
eng	poverty and for gender equality, and the Daphne Programme, which
eng	is responsible for policies for combating violence against women.

eng	trust between the Schengen States relies on countries adhering
eng	fully to their reciprocal obligations.
