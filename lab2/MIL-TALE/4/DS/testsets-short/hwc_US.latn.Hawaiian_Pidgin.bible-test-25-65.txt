hwc	Gotta listen to everyting God say,
hwc	Right den an dea, dey jus wen leave da nets, an go wit him.
hwc	But eh! I telling you guys dis: No fight back da bad guys. If
hwc	anybody slap yoa head one side, mo betta let um slap da odda

hwc	Jesus wen go down from da mountain, an plenny peopo wen go wit
hwc	Da bad kine spirits wen beg Jesus, “Wen you goin make us let

hwc	I goin give him my Spirit,
hwc	“Wen one bad kine spirit let go one guy, dat spirit go all ova
hwc	da boonies fo find one place fo rest, but no can find notting.
hwc	Cuz dis peopo get hard head,
hwc	“I goin teach um wit stories,

hwc	fo grab John, an put chain on top um, an throw um inside da

hwc	Wen dey go back inside da boat, da wind pau.
hwc	All dat bad kine stuff, dass wat come from inside da heart. Dass
hwc	why peopo stay pilau inside an dey no can pray. But if get one
hwc	guy dat no wash his hands da right way, an den he eat, dat no
hwc	goin make um pilau inside.”
hwc	You guys no undastan, still yet? Wen I wen broke da five breads

hwc	He say, “Dass right. Elijah gotta come back first an make
hwc	everyting ready fo Godʼs Spesho Guy.

hwc	Den Jesus dem come near Jerusalem an come to Betpage, da small
hwc	town on top Olive Ridge. Jesus tell two guys he teaching,
hwc	You let dem tell all da kine good stuff bout you.’ ”
hwc	Den Jesus tell um, “You guys neva read inside da Bible, o wat?
hwc	bout da stone dass jalike me:
hwc	But Jesus know dey trying fo make um any kine, an he say, “You
hwc	guys, you say one ting an do one nodda! How come you guys trying

hwc	guys wea fo go! You guys pick out one small fly from inside da
hwc	soup, but den jalike you guys let one big camel stay inside da
hwc	soup, an you swallow da whole ting!
hwc	“Daniel, da guy dat wen talk fo God befo time, he wen say dat
hwc	someting dat God hate plenny, goin happen. Dat ting so bad, goin
hwc	mess up everyting an make everybody jus bag. Da ting goin stand
hwc	inside da place dat stay spesho fo God. (Whoeva read dis, dey
hwc	“Goin get two guys working inside one field. God goin take one
hwc	guy, an he no goin take da odda guy.
hwc	“Long time afta, da boss wen come back. He wen go check out
hwc	how da worka guys wen handle all his money.
hwc	Dat time, da main priest guys an da older leadas fo da peopo wen
hwc	come togedda inside da Head Priest guy palace. Kaiafas, he da
hwc	But I goin come back alive afta I mahke, an den, I going Galilee
hwc	side. Den you guys goin go by me ova dea.”
hwc	Den da Head Priest guy wen stand up an say, “Eh, you no hear
hwc	wat dese guys saying bout you? You no goin say notting, o wat?”
hwc	An still yet Jesus neva say notting. So Pilate start fo try
hwc	You wen say dat you goin broke down da temple an goin build um
hwc	up again befo three days pau! So, we like see you get yoaself
hwc	outa dis! If you Godʼs Boy, come down from da cross now!”
hwc	Da angel guy tell da wahines, “Eh, no scared! I know you guys
hwc	looking fo Jesus, da guy dey wen kill on top da cross.
hwc	You know, Johnʼs clotheses come from da camel hair. He wen make
hwc	one rope outa leather fo belt. He eat grasshoppas, an he get
hwc	Simon dem wen go look fo him.
hwc	An same ting, you no put grape juice fo make wine inside one old
hwc	kine leather bag, an close um fo let um ferment. You do dat, da
hwc	new wine goin come mo big an bus da wine bag, an da wine goin
hwc	spill out. Da old leather no good no moa. Mo betta, you put new
hwc	wine inside new kine leather bag.”
hwc	Den Jesus wen go home. Plenny peopo wen come, jalike befo time,
hwc	so Jesus an his guys no can eat.
hwc	An I goin let um go an hemo dea shame
hwc	Dey so scared, dey wen tell each odda, “Eh, wat kine guy dis?
hwc	Even da wind an da waves do wat he tell um!”
hwc	His guys say, “How come you say dat? Get uku paila peopo
hwc	pushing aroun you. But you go aks who touch you?”
hwc	She wen go out an aks her mudda, “Wat I goin aks fo?”
hwc	Den he climb inside da boat wit dem, an da wind wen pau. Da
hwc	guys, wen really blow dea minds.
hwc	Den Jesus say, “Da kine stuff dat come outa one guy, dass wat
hwc	make him pilau inside so he no can pray.
hwc	Den he wen go way from dem, go back inside da boat, an go da
hwc	Afta six days, Jesus wen take Peter, James, an John wit him up
hwc	on top one big mountain wea neva have nobody. Den, da same time
hwc	dey stay looking at him, Jesus wen start fo look diffren in
hwc	cuz he teaching his guys stuff. He tell um, “I da Guy Dass Fo
hwc	Real. Da peopo goin set me up, an take me. Dey goin kill me, an
hwc	on day numba three I goin come back alive.”
hwc	Wen Jesus wen see wat his guys doing, he huhu. He say, “Let da
hwc	kids come! No stop dem! Cuz da peopo who make God dea King,
hwc	inside demself dey jalike dese kids.
hwc	Jesus say, “Eh, all you guys! Come ova hea! You know, da
hwc	leadas fo da peopos dat donno God, dey get any kine power ova
hwc	dea peopo. Dea main guys get da rights fo tell da peopo wat fo
hwc	Da nex day, wen dey go way from Betany fo go Jerusalem one mo
hwc	time, Jesus wen come real hungry.
hwc	So dey grab da boy an kill him, an throw him outside da grape
hwc	One teacha who teach Godʼs Rules was standing dea. He hear dem
hwc	talking, an he know dat Jesus wen shut up da Sadducee guys. So
hwc	he aks him, “Eh, from all da Rules God wen give us, wat da
hwc	Plenny guys goin show up an use my name. Dey goin say, ‘Eh,
hwc	me, I dat Spesho Christ Guy from God!’ An dey goin fool plenny
hwc	“Nobody know wen all dat goin happen, not even da day, o da

hwc	Da main priest guys an all da main leadas wen try find proof
hwc	agains Jesus so dey can kill him, but dey neva find notting.
hwc	Now, Pilate know dat da main priest guys wen give Jesus to him
hwc	cuz dey so mad at Jesus, cuz everybody listen to him an not dem.
hwc	Right den an dea da big curtain inside da temple broke in two
hwc	from da top to da bottom.
hwc	Aloha, my friend Teofilus,
hwc	God wen do plenny good stuffs fo me,
hwc	Da God fo da Israel peopo!
hwc	An dey goin mahke inside,
hwc	Befo time, Moses wen write down inside Godʼs Rules, all da
hwc	stuff dat peopo gotta do wen one baby born, cuz da mudda kapu fo
hwc	forty days an no can go pray wit da odda peopo. But wen pau da
hwc	kapu, da mudda an da fadda gotta make sacrifice, den she can go
hwc	pray wit da odda peopo. So wen da time come, Joseph an Mary wen
hwc	take Jesus to Jerusalem fo bring him inside da Temple, in front
hwc	Every year Jesus fadda an mudda wen go Jerusalem fo da Passova.
hwc	John tell, “Da guy dat get two coats gotta give one to da guy

hwc	An da guys dat da Pharisee guys teach, dey no eat so dey can

hwc	Jesus wen come down da hill wit his guys, an he stand on top one
hwc	flat place. Had plenny guys dea dat wen go wit him an plenny

hwc	Dat time some guys dat talk fo God wen come from Jerusalem to
hwc	Had guys dat wen talk fo God an guys dat wen teach wit da church
hwc	guys in Antiok: Barnabas, Simeon da Black guy, Lucius from

hwc	Wen dey wen kill Jesus, wen happen jalike da Bible wen say. An
hwc	afta, dey wen take him down from da cross an wen put him inside
hwc	Cuz dis wat da Boss wen tell us fo do,
hwc	Paul an Barnabas wen tell da Good Stuff From God Derbe town, an
hwc	plenny peopo wen learn bout Jesus an come his guys. Den dey wen
hwc	go back Lystra town, an Iconium, an Antiok.
hwc	Paul dem wen go Syria an Cilicia, an wen kokua da church guys.
hwc	He wen take um outside da place an say, “You guys, wat I gotta
hwc	do so I can come outa da bad kine stuff I stay in?”
hwc	You stay tell us some stuff we no can figga, an we like know wat
hwc	Paul wen start fo talk, but Governa Gallio wen tell da Jews,
hwc	“If you Jewish guys wen squawk bout someting dat stay wrong o

hwc	He wen stay ova dea three months. He stay ready fo sail Syria
hwc	side, but da Jewish guys wen make plan fo kill him, so he wen go

hwc	meat from da sacrifices fo da idol kine gods, o blood, o da meat
hwc	from da animals dey wen choke, an no mo fool aroun.”
hwc	He say, ‘Our ancestas God wen pick you fo know wat he like do,
hwc	an fo see Christ, da Guy Dat Stay Right, an fo hear wat he say.
hwc	Wen da sun wen come up, da Jewish guys wen come togedda an wen
hwc	make plan bout Paul. Dey make promise dat dey no goin eat o
hwc	drink notting till dey pau kill him.
hwc	but da main captain name Lysias, he come an grab him from us.
hwc	Festus wen like do someting fo da Jewish guys, so he wen tell
hwc	Paul, “You like go Jerusalem an stand in front me ova dea fo
hwc	tell bout all dis stuff?”
hwc	Plenny times I wen go from one Jewish church to da odda fo
hwc	punish um, an I wen try fo make um talk stink agains God. I wen
hwc	come plenny huhu wit dem, an I even wen go da towns far away fo
hwc	We wen lose plenny time, an da Spesho Day Fo Pray An No Eat wen
hwc	come awready. Da ocean wen stay too rough fo sail dat time. So
hwc	Wen da sun wen come up, dey neva know da land wea dey was. But
hwc	dey wen spock one bay an one sandy beach. Dey wen tink stay mo
hwc	betta fo make da boat eat it ova dea.
hwc	Dey wen go way an make argue wit each odda. But first Paul wen
hwc	say, “Godʼs Spesho Spirit wen tell yoa ancesta guys da trut!
hwc	I really like stay by you guys, cuz I like share da good kine
hwc	stuff from Godʼs Spirit wit you guys. Den you can stay mo

hwc	How you make, same ting, God goin give you back.
hwc	No matta dey say dat he do wrong,
hwc	Dey no mo respeck fo God notting.”
hwc	A da bad kine stuff da guy wen do.”
hwc	Befo time, wen still yet neva have da Rules from God, all ova da
hwc	world had peopo dat was doing bad kine stuff. But wen neva have
hwc	da Rules, nobody wen go write down wat da bad kine stuff peopo
hwc	Wat good kine ting you guys wen get from all dat stuff you wen
hwc	do? Notting! Now you guys get plenny shame weneva you guys tink
hwc	bout um. Cuz wen you do dat kine stuff, you ony cut yoaself off
hwc	Even if we do wat da Rules from God say, dat no can throw out da
hwc	bad kine stuff inside us, cuz da way us guys stay, we not strong
hwc	inside. But den God, he wen go send his own Boy fo come one guy
hwc	jalike us. Da way Jesus wen stay, God wen make him look jalike
hwc	one regula guy dat can do bad kine stuff, jalike all da odda
hwc	peopo. But den, Jesus neva do bad kine stuff -- how he wen live,
hwc	he wen show proof dat da tings da peopo was doing was bad fo
hwc	shua. Plus, he wen come one sacrifice fo hemo da shame fo da bad
hwc	kine stuff dat all da odda peopo wen do.
hwc	An den, who goin poin finga da peopo God wen pick? No mo nobody
hwc	fo do dat! Cuz God, he da One dat say dat his peopo get um right
hwc	Eh, who you tink you? How come you talk back lidat to God,
hwc	brudda? Jalike da Bible wen tell: “If get one guy dat making
hwc	one ting, da ting no can tell da guy, ‘Eh! How come you wen
hwc	So den, wat? Wat we goin say? Get all kine peopos from diffren
hwc	place dat not Jews, dey neva was trying fo get um right wit God
hwc	befo time. Now, dey get um right wit him, cuz dey stay trus um.
hwc	“All ova da world, get peopo dat wen hear da Good Stuff.
hwc	Fo shua, he like give um chance, an dass why he wen pick um. No
hwc	was cuz dey wen go do someting good, an dass why he gotta pick

hwc	do, den he no give um chance fo real kine, an he gotta pick um,
hwc	“Goin get one guy dat goin take us outa da bad kine stuff,

hwc	But if I donno wat dea language mean, da peopo dat stay talking

hwc	wen start fo tell wat God say, first time? Was you guys? Nah! O
hwc	you guys tink you da ony peopo dat eva hear wat God say? Get
hwc	Da Bible wen say befo time, “God make his Spesho Guy be da
hwc	boss ova everyting.” But you know, wen he say “everyting get
hwc	him fo boss” -- fo shua, he not talking bout God, da One dat

hwc	An dis too: every day I feel da presha fo tink hard bout all da

hwc	give Christ da power fo live now, an he wen give us da power fo
hwc	live too wit Christ an work fo you guys.

hwc	If one guy tink he hot stuff wen he not, dat guy, he ony bulai
hwc	Wen we stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, dass da first proof fo show
hwc	us all da good kine stuff God goin give his kids. Bumbye God

hwc	dey goin go down on dea knees in front him.
hwc	Dey tell, “Fo be Godʼs guy fo real kine, gotta cut skin.”
hwc	But you know, us guys, we da guys dat get Godʼs Spirit. Dass
