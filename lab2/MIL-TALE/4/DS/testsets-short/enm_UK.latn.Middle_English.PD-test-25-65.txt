enm	But go ye, and lerne what it is, Y wole merci, and not

enm	Jhesus sente these twelue, and comaundide hem, and seide, Go ye

enm	And al the puple wondride, and seide, Whether this be the sone
enm	And he spac to hem many thingis in parablis, and seide, Lo! he

enm	Another parable Jhesus spac to hem, The kyngdom of heuenes is
enm	lijk to sour douy, which a womman took, and hidde in thre

enm	And he willynge to sle hym, dredde the puple; for thei hadden

enm	and thei schulen sle hym, and the thridde day he schal rise ayen

enm	Thanne the modir of the sones of Zebedee cam to hym with hir

enm	he tristide in God; delyuer he hym now, if he wole; for he
enm	seide, That Y am Goddis sone.
enm	And go ye soone, and seie ye to his disciplis, that he is risun.
enm	And lo! he schal go bifore you in to Galilee; there ye schulen
enm	And Jhesus seide to hem, Come ye aftir me; Y schal make you to

enm	And it was herd, that he was in an hous, and many camen to
enm	gidir, so that thei miyten not be in the hous, ne at the yate.
enm	And he spak to hem the word.
enm	And he seith to hem, Is it leeueful to do wel in the sabatis,

enm	And he myyte not do there ony vertu, saue that he helide a fewe

enm	And whanne it was forth daies, hise disciplis camen, and seiden,
enm	This is a desert place, and the tyme is now passid;
enm	And he seide to hem, Wel ye han maad the maundement of God
enm	voide, `to kepe youre tradicioun.
enm	he seide to hem, I haue reuth on the puple, for lo! now the
enm	thridde dai thei abiden me, and han not what to ete;
enm	And he spak pleynli the word. And Peter took hym, and bigan to
enm	blame hym, and seide, Lord, be thou merciful to thee, for this
enm	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn the puple rennynge togidere, he
enm	manasside the vnclene spirit, and seide to hym, Thou deef and
enm	doumbe spirit, Y comaunde thee, go out fro hym, and entre no
enm	And thei seiden, Moises suffride to write a libel of forsaking,
enm	and bispete hym, and bete him; and thei schulen sle hym, and in

enm	And anothir daye, whanne he wente out of Betanye, he hungride.
enm	Thanne what schal the lord of the vynyerd do? He schal come, and
enm	lese the tilieris, and yyue the vynyerd to othere.
enm	and be salutid in chepyng, and sitte in synagogis in the firste

enm	But bi the feeste dai he was wont to leeue to hem oon of men
enm	boundun, whom euer thei axiden.
enm	And oon ranne, and fillide a spounge with vynegre, and puttide
enm	aboute to a reede, and yaf to hym drynke, and seide, Suffre ye,
enm	se we, if Helie come to do hym doun.
enm	And the Lord Jhesu, aftir he hadde spokun to hem, was takun vp
enm	in to heuene, and he sittith on the riythalf of God.
enm	And whanne sche hadde herd, sche was troublid in his word, and

enm	of the temple, and seide to hym, If thou art Goddis sone, sende
enm	thi silf fro hennes doun;
enm	And Jhesus stood ouer hir, and comaundide to the feuer, and it
