eng	The Jewish leaders told Herod that they were happy for him to kill James, so Herod told his soldiers to grab Peter too.
eng	They grabbed him at the time for the Jewish people to have their ceremony where they ate flat damper.
eng	There were some good Christians in the church in the town called Antioch. They were men that told God’s messages and
eng	taught God’s word to people. They were Barnabas, and Simeon (his other name was Niger), and Lucius from the land
eng	called Cyrene, and Manaen (he grew up with the big boss called Herod), and Saul.
eng	Listen, friends. Some of you are Jews that belong to our grand-father Abraham’s family, and some of you are not Jews
eng	but you respect our God. All of you listen to this message that God sent to us. It is about the way God wants to save

eng	Paul kept going, and he came to the towns called Derbe and Lystra. A Christian man called Timothy lived there.

eng	Later, in the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were praying aloud to God and saying that he is really good, and they
eng	The Jews that lived in Berea were happy to listen to the message about Jesus and they thought about it carefully, not
eng	like the Jews in Thessalonica. The Berea people read God’s book every day to find out if Paul’s message was true.
eng	That is the way the message about Jesus got very powerful, and a lot of people heard that message.
eng	He visited all the Christians in the towns in Macedonia, and he told them a lot of things to help them be strong for
eng	And you know that I told you all of God’s message, everything that will help you. I didn’t keep anything secret. I
eng	taught you God’s message in places where everyone heard me, and I taught you in your homes too.
eng	We left Tyre on that ship and went to a town called Ptolemais. There were Christians in that town too, so we went and
eng	The light was so bright that I fell down to the ground. Then I heard the voice of somebody talking to me from the sky.
eng	Don’t do what they will ask you to do. There are more than 40 men that will hide beside that road and wait for Paul
eng	to come along, so they can grab him and kill him. They even promised God that they will not eat or drink anything until
eng	they kill Paul. They are ready right now. They are just waiting for you to agree to do what they want.”
eng	If you ask him questions you will find out for yourself that everything we are telling you is true.”
eng	Then they asked Festus, “Can you tell your soldiers to bring Paul to Jerusalem right now, and judge him here?” You
eng	see, they were going to secretly hide near the road and wait for Paul to come along, then jump up and kill him.
eng	So I asked them, ‘What did he do?’ And I found out that he didn’t do anything bad, so we can’t kill him. But
eng	then he asked me to send him to Rome, for our biggest boss to judge him, so now I reckon I will send him to Rome.
eng	And Paul said, “I told everyone this message, but some of the Jewish people didn’t like it, so they grabbed me and

eng	After Paul was in Rome for 3 days, he sent a message to the Jewish leaders to come and talk with him. So they came, and
eng	Paul said to them, “My brothers, I didn’t do anything bad to our people, and I didn’t say anything bad about our
eng	Jewish culture. But our leaders in Jerusalem grabbed me, and they started to kill me. Then the boss of the Roman

eng	Or maybe God gave you the power to cheer people up, well this is your job. Or maybe he gave you the power to share your
eng	money and things with other people, well he wants you to share it with people that need things. Or maybe God gave you
eng	the power to be a leader, well you have to try to lead people properly. Or if God gave you the power to feel sorry for
eng	people that have troubles, and the power to be good to them, well this is his job for you, so be happy while you do it.
eng	God’s law says, “Love other people just as much as you love yourself.” You know there are lots of other laws too,
eng	like, “Don’t sleep with people that you are not married to, as if they are they are your wives or husbands,” and,
eng	“Don’t murder anybody,” and, “Don’t steal anything,” and, “Don’t think about getting something for
eng	yourself if it belongs to somebody else.” But if you really love other people you will not do any of these wrong
eng	things anyway. So this law, that says to love people, it says what all the other laws put together are saying.
eng	So don’t eat any meat, and don’t drink any wine if another Christian will get upset and go wrong if you do it.
eng	and he picked me out to be a special worker for Jesus Christ. My job is to tell the good news about Jesus to you mob
eng	that are not Jews. Then God’s spirit works in you to make you good and right, and God is really happy with you. It is

eng	people and he joined you to Jesus Christ. You are in God’s family now, along with everyone that says to Jesus, “You

eng	These are the things that we tell you about. We don’t use words that smart people taught us, but we use the words
eng	that God’s spirit teaches us. And we explain God’s message to people that have God’s spirit living inside them.
eng	You see, some of you reckon you are really great, and you say, “Paul is frightened to come back here.”
eng	Listen. You know what will happen to bad people, don’t you? They will not be in God’s family. They will never get
eng	the good things that God will give to his people in heaven. Don’t let anyone trick you about this. I’ll tell you
eng	now about the kind of people that will not be in God’s family. People that play around with somebody they are not
eng	married to, and sleep with them, they will not be in God’s family. Or 2 men that sleep together and do what is wrong,
eng	they will not be in God’s family. And people that respect other spirits more than they respect God,

eng	You know, everyone that works gets some sort of pay for their work. You know about soldiers. They don’t have to buy
eng	their own food or their gear. And you know about gardeners. They work, and they always eat some of the food they grow.
eng	And it is the same for people that look after cows. They work, and they can drink some of the milk they get. You see,
eng	it’s right for people to work and then get something for it. So, if my work is to tell you about Jesus, it’s right
eng	for you to give me something for my work. But I never ask you to give me anything.
eng	My friends, do you remember the story about my mob, the Israel people, a long time ago? They all followed Moses and
eng	walked out into the hot dry country, and God covered them all with a big cloud, and this cloud showed them where to go.
eng	Then they came to the Red Sea and God pushed the water back so that they all walked through the Red Sea on dry ground.
eng	Don’t just think about yourself, and what is good for you, but think about what is good for other people.
eng	It’s like this, God made the first woman by taking a part of the first man, but after that every man was born from a
eng	And don’t come to that meeting hungry. If you are hungry, eat something at home before you come to the meeting, so
eng	But we don’t need to cover the beautiful parts of our bodies. God has joined all these parts together to make one
eng	body. We might think some parts are not important, but God has made them really important.
eng	You know, I talked to you already about the special power that God gives to his people, and now I’m telling you that
eng	one day we will stop using that special power. But we can’t stop loving people. If you love somebody properly you
eng	will always love them. But the time will come when God will not need to give us special power any more. When that time
eng	comes God will not tell some people his special messages, and God will not get some people to talk in special
eng	You see, it is like this. If I pray in a special language, I’m not using my mind. I’m not thinking about my words

eng	Listen, this is the true story. Jesus Christ died, and God made him alive again. Jesus was the first person to die and
eng	Every kind of thing that is alive has a different kind of body from every other kind of thing. People have one kind of
eng	body. Animals have a different kind of body. Birds have another kind of body, and fish have another kind of body.
eng	Do it like this. On the 1st day of every week, each of you can pick out some of the money that you got that week, and
eng	keep it in a separate place. I will come to you soon, and you will have this money ready for me. You will not have to
eng	3-4 You see, Titus was there with me, and he is a Greek man, not a Jew. But there were some Jewish men that came
eng	secretly into the church in Jerusalem. They reckoned they believed in Jesus, but they didn’t really trust him
eng	properly. They only came into the church to see what we were doing. And they reckoned that Titus had to follow the
eng	Jewish law and have a young man’s operation. But, you see, if we belong to Jesus Christ we are free from that law.
eng	So God will be good to everyone that believes him, just like he was good to Abraham when Abraham believed God.
eng	And when we became God’s kids he sent his son’s spirit to live right inside us. His spirit in us gets us to call
eng	You see, it is like this. We all have a bad part in us that makes us want to do bad things, to make us feel good. And
eng	we also have God’s spirit in us, and he makes us want to do good things. These 2 are both in you, and they both want
eng	to control you, so they are fighting each other inside you all the time. Whenever you listen to God’s spirit and try
eng	to do I good things, that bad part in you tries to stop you, so you don’t do what you really want to do.
eng	You see, it doesn’t matter whether anyone did a young man’s operation on you, or not. The most important thing is
eng	I know you heard about what God did. He is very good to you, and he picked me to tell you his message.
eng	You see, Jesus Christ has been good to us. He has given us each a spiritual gift. He gives each one of us the spiritual

eng	Now I’m talking to bosses. You have to do the same, you have to be good to your workers. Don’t say anything to
eng	frighten them. Don’t tell them you want to punish them. Remember that God in heaven is your boss, and he is the boss
eng	of your workers too. And he treats everyone the same, no matter whether you are a boss or a worker.
eng	Yes, I love you, just like Jesus Christ loves you, and I want to be with you again. God himself knows this is true.
eng	3-4 Each of you has to think about what is good for the others. Don’t only think about what is good for yourself.
eng	Don’t think that you are better than other people, but think that they are better than you. And don’t do things
eng	only to get people to say you are good. Don’t try to be a boss over other people, but let others be boss over you.
eng	And all of us have to think like this if we are spiritually strong now and live properly for Jesus. But if you think
eng	But right now I have everything I need, and even more than I need. You gave all these things to Epaphroditus to bring
eng	to me, and I’m happy to get them. But you didn’t only give them to me. You gave them to God. You gave him the right
eng	But God got Jesus Christ to live in a human body and then die, so that now you can come back to God and be his friends.

eng	And now I am talking to you fathers. Don’t be rough on your children. Don’t make them get angry with you, or they
eng	And friends, do you know what happened to the people in the churches in Judea country? They believed in Jesus and their
eng	Jewish countrymen gave them a lot of trouble. And it is the same for you now. You believe in Jesus and your countrymen
eng	give you a lot of trouble. That Jewish mob didn’t want to believe God, and they made trouble for Jesus too.
eng	None of you men can ever sleep with a woman that is not your own wife. If you do that, you are taking something that
eng	belongs to another man. He is like your brother, but you are doing a bad thing to him. And God will punish you if you
eng	Our Christian friends, we know you are learning to trust God more and more, and you are loving each other more and
eng	So then, friends, you have to keep strong and keep on properly trusting Jesus. Keep on believing the things that we
eng	taught you. You see, Jesus taught us those things, and later we taught them to you. We told you those things when we
eng	were there with you, and after that we wrote letters to you to tell you more. Keep on believing those things.
eng	3-4 Do you remember the time that we were in Ephesus, and I got up to go to Macedonia? At that time I wanted you to
eng	straighten out those people in Ephesus that teach the wrong message, so I told you to stay there. Those people think a
eng	lot about old time stories that are not true, and they think about the lists of names of people in their family. Then
eng	from there they teach people lies. People that listen to them just get into useless arguments. People shouldn’t do
eng	that, but they have to learn about God and the way he works. They have to learn to believe in God and to do whatever he
eng	wants. So I want you to tell those lying teachers to stop teaching those wrong things.
eng	And in your meetings, I want the women to dress properly and sensibly. They can’t dress in a way that makes men look
eng	at them. They can’t think about the fancy clothes they will wear, or their fancy hairdo, or the jewels that they want

eng	will not only live better lives now but we will live a lot better in the life that will come after we die, just like
eng	God promised us. That is a lot better for us.” If people tell this message they tell a true story, and everybody has
