hwc	Befo time, wen still yet neva have da Rules from God, all ova da world had peopo dat was doing bad kine stuff. But wen
hwc	Wat good kine ting you guys wen get from all dat stuff you wen do? Notting! Now you guys get plenny shame weneva you
hwc	guys tink bout um. Cuz wen you do dat kine stuff, you ony cut yoaself off from God.
hwc	Even if we do wat da Rules from God say, dat no can throw out da bad kine stuff inside us, cuz da way us guys stay, we
hwc	not strong inside. But den God, he wen go send his own Boy fo come one guy jalike us. Da way Jesus wen stay, God wen
hwc	make him look jalike one regula guy dat can do bad kine stuff, jalike all da odda peopo. But den, Jesus neva do bad
hwc	kine stuff -- how he wen live, he wen show proof dat da tings da peopo was doing was bad fo shua. Plus, he wen come one
hwc	An den, who goin poin finga da peopo God wen pick? No mo nobody fo do dat! Cuz God, he da One dat say dat his peopo get
hwc	Eh, who you tink you? How come you talk back lidat to God, brudda? Jalike da Bible wen tell: “If get one guy dat
hwc	making one ting, da ting no can tell da guy, ‘Eh! How come you wen make me lidis?’ ”
hwc	So den, wat? Wat we goin say? Get all kine peopos from diffren place dat not Jews, dey neva was trying fo get um right
hwc	Fo shua, he like give um chance, an dass why he wen pick um. No was cuz dey wen go do someting good, an dass why he
hwc	gotta pick um, you know. If he gotta pick um cuz a da good tings dey wen do, den he no give um chance fo real kine, an
hwc	Dat mean, if get somebody dat go agains da kine peopo dat get dat kine power, az jalike dey going agains da way how God
hwc	wen go make one govermen fo us. If get anybody dat make lidat, dey goin get it from God da Judge.
hwc	Eh, bruddas an sistas, I aks you guys fo pray hard wit me dat God goin help me. You guys pray cuz Jesus Christ yoa
hwc	He da ony God dat stay, an he know everyting. I like everybody tell how awesome he stay foeva, cuz a wat Jesus Christ
hwc	Cuz no matta da peopo tink God stupid, he still mo smart den dem. No matta dey tink God not strong, he still mo strong
hwc	Me an Apollos an Peter, we stay fo you guys! An da whole world stay fo you guys, no matta you alive o mahke! Everyting
hwc	dat stay happening right now, an everyting dat goin happen lata -- everyting stay fo you guys!
hwc	Us guys, we jalike da Bread Dat No Mo Yeast Inside, dat da Jewish peopo make fo eat Passova time. So us guys gotta
hwc	watch out dat we no do da bad kine stuff, o hurt da odda peopo. We wen make lidat befo time. Mo betta tell da trut
hwc	No hold back from each odda. You can fo short time, but ony if da husban an da wife tell each odda dey goin hold back
hwc	fo get time fo pray. An den come back togedda, so da Devil no can make you guys presha make you fool aroun behind da
hwc	oddaʼs back. But if you no come back togedda fast, you no goin be strong nuff fo say “No!” to da Devil.
hwc	I telling you guys dis stuff, cuz good fo you guys. I no like jam up you guys. I like you guys do da right ting, an
hwc	know wat da Boss like you fo do an be ready fo do um, an no worry bout odda kine stuffs.
hwc	You no tink me an Barnabas get da right fo get stuff fo eat an drink from da peopo we teach?
hwc	All dat stuff wen happen fo show us guys dat we not suppose to go all out fo do da bad kine stuff, jalike all da peopo
hwc	I get someting I like tell you folks -- you all good guys, cuz you guys tink bout me all da time, no matta wat. All da
hwc	Wen da Boss punish us guys, you know, he do dat fo teach us guys da right way. He no like us get punish an wipe out wit
hwc	If one part a da body suffa, all da odda parts suffa, same time. If one part a da body stay awesome, all da odda parts
hwc	But if I donno wat dea language mean, da peopo dat stay talking lidat, I goin know dat dey not from my peopo, an dey
hwc	Wot! If you guys no like, try tink bout dis: Who was da guys dat wen start fo tell wat God say, first time? Was you
hwc	Da Bible wen say befo time, “God make his Spesho Guy be da boss ova everyting.” But you know, wen he say
hwc	“everyting get him fo boss” -- fo shua, he not talking bout God, da One dat wen make him be da boss ova everyting.
hwc	Az why I wen write befo dat I not going yet, so dat you guys can make everyting right, an den wen I go ova dea, I no
hwc	goin feel all sad cuz a you guys dat suppose to make me feel good inside. I know all you guys, so I know dat wen I stay
hwc	But weneva somebody start fo trus da Boss, Christ help um undastan inside dea hearts. Jalike da Bible wen tell bout
hwc	You know, we all gotta go in front Christ da Judge, an no can hide notting. Dat time we goin get back wat we wen do wen
hwc	Dey wen beg us plenny fo let um help give money fo kokua da peopo dat stay spesho fo God, Jerusalem side.
hwc	But I tell you guys dis: “Da guy who plant litto bit seed, he goin get one small crop. Da guy dat plant plenny seed
hwc	You know, da Bible say, “Da guy who talk big, let um talk big bout God da Boss.”
hwc	An dis too: every day I feel da presha fo tink hard bout all da bruddas an sistas dat come togedda fo God all ova da
hwc	Christ neva have power wen dey wen kill him on top da cross. An us guys neva have power jalike Christ get power. But
hwc	God wen give Christ da power fo live now, an he wen give us da power fo live too wit Christ an work fo you guys.
hwc	Jalike Abraham. He wen trus God. Az why God wen say Abraham get um right wit him.
hwc	Dass why you guys not jalike slaves no moa dat gotta do wat da Rules say. Now you guys Godʼs kids! An God goin give
hwc	Wat da Bible say? “Throw out da slave wahine an her boy, cuz her boy no goin get da good stuff da fadda like give his
hwc	Wen we stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, dass da first proof fo show us all da good kine stuff God goin give his kids.
hwc	Bumbye God goin cut loose his kids from all da power dat da bad kine stuff get ova dem, an den everybody goin tell how
hwc	Da whole house line up real good cuz a Christ. An dat house coming one temple dat stay spesho fo da Good Boss.
hwc	Try pray fo me too, so wen I tell da Good Kine Stuff From God, I tell um da right way an I no scared. You know, nobody
hwc	Dey tell, “Fo be Godʼs guy fo real kine, gotta cut skin.” But you know, us guys, we da guys dat get Godʼs Spirit.
hwc	Dass jalike da mark fo show dat we Godʼs guys fo real kine, not dem. Cuz wen we do stuff fo God, da Spirit help us do
hwc	um, dass why. Us guys can feel real proud cuz we stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Guy, Jesus Christ. We no tink we okay jus
hwc	I no say dis cuz I need someting. I wen learn dat I get nuff stuff awready. I stay good inside no matta wat happen.
hwc	Watch out! No let nobody hemo you guys from da trut! Dey goin try teach you guys wrong kine stuff wit any kine talk.
hwc	Dey get all dis kine teaching ony from peopo, from now an from befo time, an from da spirits dat stay in charge a da
hwc	Let Christ take charge a you guys an make yoa hearts rest inside. He wen tell all you guys fo come togedda an stay
hwc	Every time us guys go pray, we talk to God bout all you guys, an we say, “Mahalo plenny, God, fo da church peopo
hwc	An we wen send Timoty so you guys no presha out wen peopo make you suffa. Cuz you guys know awready dat God let dat
hwc	Cuz you guys know awready dat da time wen da Boss goin come back, goin be jalike wen one steala guy go sneak inside yoa

hwc	But da Boss, we can trus him. He goin make you guys come mo strong an solid inside, an no goin let anybody hurt you.
