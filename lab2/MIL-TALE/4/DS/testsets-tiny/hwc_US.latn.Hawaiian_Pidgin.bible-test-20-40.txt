hwc	God. I wen come plenny huhu wit dem, an
hwc	I even wen go da towns far away fo make
hwc	We wen lose plenny time, an da Spesho
hwc	Day Fo Pray An No Eat wen come awready.
hwc	Da ocean wen stay too rough fo sail dat
hwc	time. So Paul wen tell um,
hwc	Wen da sun wen come up, dey neva know
hwc	da land wea dey was. But dey wen spock
hwc	one bay an one sandy beach. Dey wen
hwc	tink stay mo betta fo make da boat eat
hwc	Dey wen go way an make argue wit each
hwc	odda. But first Paul wen say, “Godʼs
hwc	Spesho Spirit wen tell yoa ancesta guys
hwc	da trut! Isaiah wen talk fo him
hwc	I really like stay by you guys, cuz I
hwc	like share da good kine stuff from

hwc	A da bad kine stuff da guy wen do.”
hwc	Befo time, wen still yet neva have da
hwc	Rules from God, all ova da world had
hwc	peopo dat was doing bad kine stuff. But
hwc	wen neva have da Rules, nobody wen go
hwc	write down wat da bad kine stuff peopo
hwc	Wat good kine ting you guys wen get
hwc	from all dat stuff you wen do? Notting!
hwc	Now you guys get plenny shame weneva

hwc	dat kine stuff, you ony cut yoaself off
hwc	Even if we do wat da Rules from God
hwc	say, dat no can throw out da bad kine
hwc	stuff inside us, cuz da way us guys
hwc	stay, we not strong inside. But den

hwc	stay, God wen make him look jalike one
hwc	regula guy dat can do bad kine stuff,
hwc	jalike all da odda peopo. But den,
hwc	Jesus neva do bad kine stuff -- how he
hwc	wen live, he wen show proof dat da
hwc	tings da peopo was doing was bad fo
hwc	shua. Plus, he wen come one sacrifice
hwc	fo hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff
hwc	dat all da odda peopo wen do.
hwc	An den, who goin poin finga da peopo
hwc	God wen pick? No mo nobody fo do dat!
hwc	Cuz God, he da One dat say dat his
hwc	peopo get um right wit him awready.
hwc	Eh, who you tink you? How come you talk

hwc	Bible wen tell: “If get one guy dat
hwc	making one ting, da ting no can tell da

hwc	So den, wat? Wat we goin say? Get all
hwc	kine peopos from diffren place dat not
hwc	Jews, dey neva was trying fo get um
hwc	right wit God befo time. Now, dey get

hwc	Everyting dat stay happening right now,
hwc	an everyting dat goin happen lata --
hwc	everyting stay fo you guys!
hwc	Us guys, we jalike da Bread Dat No Mo
hwc	Yeast Inside, dat da Jewish peopo make
hwc	fo eat Passova time. So us guys gotta
hwc	watch out dat we no do da bad kine
hwc	stuff, o hurt da odda peopo. We wen
hwc	make lidat befo time. Mo betta tell da
hwc	trut everytime, so everybody can see
hwc	dat we do everyting wit good heart.
hwc	No hold back from each odda. You can fo
hwc	short time, but ony if da husban an da
hwc	wife tell each odda dey goin hold back
hwc	fo get time fo pray. An den come back
hwc	togedda, so da Devil no can make you

hwc	back togedda fast, you no goin be
hwc	strong nuff fo say “No!” to da
hwc	I telling you guys dis stuff, cuz good
hwc	fo you guys. I no like jam up you guys.
hwc	I like you guys do da right ting, an

hwc	You no tink me an Barnabas get da right
hwc	fo get stuff fo eat an drink from da

hwc	da stuff I wen teach you guys, you guys
hwc	still yet stay do um. Right on!
hwc	Wen da Boss punish us guys, you know,
hwc	he do dat fo teach us guys da right
hwc	way. He no like us get punish an wipe
hwc	out wit all da peopo inside da world,
hwc	If one part a da body suffa, all da
hwc	odda parts suffa, same time. If one
hwc	part a da body stay awesome, all da
hwc	odda parts feel good, same time.
hwc	But if I donno wat dea language mean,
hwc	da peopo dat stay talking lidat, I goin
hwc	know dat dey not from my peopo, an dey
hwc	goin know dat I not from dea peopo.
hwc	Wot! If you guys no like, try tink bout
hwc	dis: Who was da guys dat wen start fo
hwc	tell wat God say, first time? Was you
hwc	guys? Nah! O you guys tink you da ony
hwc	peopo dat eva hear wat God say? Get
hwc	Da Bible wen say befo time, “God make
hwc	his Spesho Guy be da boss ova
hwc	everyting.” But you know, wen he say
hwc	“everyting get him fo boss” -- fo
hwc	shua, he not talking bout God, da One
hwc	dat wen make him be da boss ova
hwc	“Marana Tha!” You know wat dat
hwc	mean, Aramaic language? “Eh, Boss!
hwc	Az why I wen write befo dat I not going
hwc	yet, so dat you guys can make everyting
hwc	right, an den wen I go ova dea, I no
hwc	goin feel all sad cuz a you guys dat
hwc	suppose to make me feel good inside. I
hwc	know all you guys, so I know dat wen I
hwc	stay good inside, den you guys goin
hwc	stay good inside, jalike me.
hwc	But weneva somebody start fo trus da
hwc	Boss, Christ help um undastan inside
hwc	dea hearts. Jalike da Bible wen tell
hwc	bout Moses, “He take away da ting dat
hwc	You know, we all gotta go in front
hwc	Christ da Judge, an no can hide
hwc	notting. Dat time we goin get back wat
hwc	we wen do wen we wen stay inside dis
hwc	world, da good kine stuff o da no good
hwc	Dey wen beg us plenny fo let um help
hwc	give money fo kokua da peopo dat stay
hwc	spesho fo God, Jerusalem side.
hwc	But I tell you guys dis: “Da guy who
hwc	plant litto bit seed, he goin get one
hwc	small crop. Da guy dat plant plenny
hwc	seed wit good heart, he goin get mo
hwc	plenny crop, an he goin stay good
hwc	You know, da Bible say, “Da guy who
hwc	talk big, let um talk big bout God da
hwc	An dis too: every day I feel da presha
hwc	fo tink hard bout all da bruddas an
hwc	sistas dat come togedda fo God all ova
hwc	Christ neva have power wen dey wen kill
hwc	him on top da cross. An us guys neva
hwc	have power jalike Christ get power. But
hwc	God wen give Christ da power fo live
hwc	now, an he wen give us da power fo live
hwc	too wit Christ an work fo you guys.
hwc	Den I wen go Syria an Cilicia side.
hwc	Jalike Abraham. He wen trus God. Az why
hwc	God wen say Abraham get um right wit
hwc	Dass why you guys not jalike slaves no
hwc	moa dat gotta do wat da Rules say. Now
hwc	you guys Godʼs kids! An God goin give
hwc	you guys everyting he goin give his
hwc	Wat da Bible say? “Throw out da slave
hwc	wahine an her boy, cuz her boy no goin
hwc	get da good stuff da fadda like give
hwc	If one guy tink he hot stuff wen he
hwc	not, dat guy, he ony bulai himself.
hwc	Wen we stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit,
hwc	dass da first proof fo show us all da
hwc	good kine stuff God goin give his kids.
hwc	Bumbye God goin cut loose his kids from
hwc	all da power dat da bad kine stuff get
hwc	ova dem, an den everybody goin tell how
hwc	Da whole house line up real good cuz a
hwc	Christ. An dat house coming one temple
hwc	dat stay spesho fo da Good Boss.
hwc	Dey stay tight wit ony one Guy.
hwc	An no let da Devil get one chance fo
hwc	Dat mean, you wifes, listen to yoa own
hwc	husbans, jalike you listen to da Boss.
hwc	Try pray fo me too, so wen I tell da
hwc	Good Kine Stuff From God, I tell um da
hwc	right way an I no scared. You know,
hwc	nobody wen undastan dat stuff befo
hwc	time, cuz was secret.
hwc	But if I stay hea inside da world, dat
hwc	goin be mo betta fo you guys.
hwc	dey goin go down on dea knees in front
hwc	Dey tell, “Fo be Godʼs guy fo real
hwc	kine, gotta cut skin.” But you know,
hwc	us guys, we da guys dat get Godʼs
hwc	Spirit. Dass jalike da mark fo show dat
hwc	we Godʼs guys fo real kine, not dem.
hwc	Cuz wen we do stuff fo God, da Spirit
hwc	help us do um, dass why. Us guys can
hwc	feel real proud cuz we stay tight wit
hwc	Godʼs Spesho Guy, Jesus Christ. We no
hwc	tink we okay jus cuz somebody wen do
hwc	someting to our body.
hwc	I no say dis cuz I need someting. I wen
hwc	learn dat I get nuff stuff awready. I
hwc	stay good inside no matta wat happen.
hwc	Inside da sky an inside da world,
hwc	Watch out! No let nobody hemo you guys
hwc	from da trut! Dey goin try teach you
hwc	guys wrong kine stuff wit any kine
hwc	talk. Dey get all dis kine teaching ony
