enm	And Moises stood in the yate of the

enm	the sones of Leuy weren gaderid to hym.
enm	And eft God seide, A place is anentis

enm	As a sacrifice is offrid for synne, so

enm	This is the lawe of brent sacrifice,
enm	and of sacrifice for synne, and for
enm	trespas, and for halewyng, and for the
enm	sacrifices of pesible thingis;
enm	He took also the brest of the ram of
enm	consecracioun in to his part, and
enm	reiside it bifor the Lord, as the Lord
enm	Sotheli Moyses and Aaron entriden in to

enm	And the tempter cam nyy, and seide to

enm	Blessid ben thei that ben of clene

enm	Whether men gaderen grapis of thornes,
enm	that it were fulfillid, that was seid
enm	by Ysaie, the profete, seiynge, He took

enm	But go ye, and lerne what it is, Y wole
enm	merci, and not sacrifice; for I cam,
enm	not to clepe riytful men, but synful
enm	Jhesus sente these twelue, and
enm	comaundide hem, and seide, Go ye not

enm	And al the puple wondride, and seide,
enm	Whether this be the sone of Dauid?
enm	And he spac to hem many thingis in
enm	parablis, and seide, Lo! he that
enm	sowith, yede out to sowe his seed.
enm	Another parable Jhesus spac to hem, The
enm	kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to sour
enm	douy, which a womman took, and hidde in
enm	thre mesuris of mele, til it were alle
enm	And he willynge to sle hym, dredde the

enm	And whanne men of that place hadden
enm	knowe hym, thei senten in to al that
enm	cuntre; and thei brouyten to hym alle
enm	that hadden siknesse.
enm	And whanne Jhesus hadde passed fro
enm	thennus, he cam bisidis the see of
enm	Galilee. And he yede vp in to an hil,
enm	Thanne he comaundide to hise disciplis,
enm	that thei schulden seie to no man, that
enm	and thei schulen sle hym, and the
enm	thridde day he schal rise ayen to lijf.
enm	And whanne he hadde not wherof to
enm	yelde, his lord comaundide hym to be
enm	seld, and his wijf, and children, and
enm	alle thingis that he hadde, and to be
enm	The yonge man seith to hym, Y haue kept

enm	onourynge, and axynge sum thing of hym.
enm	and seiden to hym, Herist thou what
enm	these seien? And Jhesus seide to hem,
enm	Yhe; whether ye han neuer redde, That
enm	of the mouth of yonge children, and of
enm	soukynge childryn, thou hast maad
enm	And thei souyten to holde hym, but thei

enm	for this thing ye schulen take more
enm	For many schulen come in my name, and
enm	schulen seie, Y am Crist; and thei
enm	schulen disseyue manye.
enm	heuene and erthe schulen passe, but my
enm	wordis schulen not passe.
enm	For as a man that goith in pilgrimage,
enm	clepide hise seruauntis, and bitook to
enm	Thanne and thei schulen answere to hym,
enm	and schulen seie, Lord, whanne sayn we
enm	thee hungrynge, or thristynge, or
enm	herboreles, or nakid, or sijk, or in
enm	prisoun, and we serueden not to thee?
enm	and seide, Drynke ye alle herof; this
enm	is my blood of the newe testament,
enm	which schal be sched for many, in to
enm	remissioun of synnes.
enm	But Petir swede him afer, in to the
enm	halle of the prince of prestis; and he
enm	wente in, and sat with the seruauntis,
enm	Thanne Pilat seith to him, Herist thou
enm	not, hou many witnessyngis thei seien
enm	he tristide in God; delyuer he hym now,
enm	if he wole; for he seide, That Y am
enm	And go ye soone, and seie ye to his
enm	disciplis, that he is risun. And lo! he
enm	schal go bifore you in to Galilee;
enm	there ye schulen se hym.
enm	And Jhesus seide to hem, Come ye aftir
enm	me; Y schal make you to be maad
enm	And it was herd, that he was in an
enm	hous, and many camen to gidir, so that
enm	thei miyten not be in the hous, ne at
enm	the yate. And he spak to hem the word.
enm	And he seith to hem, Is it leeueful to
enm	do wel in the sabatis, ether yuel? to
enm	make a soul saaf, ether to leese? And
enm	And he bihelde thilke that saten aboute
enm	hym, and seide, Lo! my modir and my
enm	And whanne of it silf it hath brouyt
enm	forth fruyt, anoon he sendith a sikil,
enm	for repyng tyme is come.
enm	And whanne he yede up in to a boot, he
enm	that was trauelid of the deuel, bigan
enm	to preie hym, that he schulde be with
enm	And he myyte not do there ony vertu,
enm	saue that he helide a fewe sijk men,
enm	leiynge on hem hise hoondis.
enm	And whanne it was forth daies, hise
enm	disciplis camen, and seiden, This is a
enm	desert place, and the tyme is now
enm	And he seide to hem, Wel ye han maad
enm	the maundement of God voide, `to kepe
enm	he seide to hem, I haue reuth on the
enm	puple, for lo! now the thridde dai thei
enm	abiden me, and han not what to ete;
enm	And he spak pleynli the word. And Peter
enm	took hym, and bigan to blame hym, and
enm	seide, Lord, be thou merciful to thee,
enm	for this schal not be.
enm	And whanne Jhesus hadde seyn the puple
enm	rennynge togidere, he manasside the
enm	vnclene spirit, and seide to hym, Thou
enm	deef and doumbe spirit, Y comaunde
enm	thee, go out fro hym, and entre no more
enm	And thei seiden, Moises suffride to
enm	write a libel of forsaking, and to
enm	and bispete hym, and bete him; and thei
enm	schulen sle hym, and in the thridde dai
enm	And anothir daye, whanne he wente out
enm	of Betanye, he hungride.
enm	Thanne what schal the lord of the
enm	vynyerd do? He schal come, and lese the
enm	tilieris, and yyue the vynyerd to
enm	and be salutid in chepyng, and sitte in
enm	synagogis in the firste chaieris, and
enm	the firste sittyng placis in soperis;
enm	and the sterris of heuene schulen falle
enm	doun, and the vertues that ben in
enm	heuenes, schulen be moued.
enm	And whanne thei saten `at the mete, and
enm	eeten, Jhesus seide, Treuli Y seie to
enm	you, that oon of you that etith with
enm	me, schal bitray me.
enm	And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem,
enm	As to a theef ye han gon out with
enm	swerdis and staues, to take me?
enm	But bi the feeste dai he was wont to
enm	leeue to hem oon of men boundun, whom
enm	And oon ranne, and fillide a spounge
enm	with vynegre, and puttide aboute to a
enm	reede, and yaf to hym drynke, and
enm	seide, Suffre ye, se we, if Helie come
enm	And the Lord Jhesu, aftir he hadde
enm	spokun to hem, was takun vp in to

enm	And whanne sche hadde herd, sche was
enm	troublid in his word, and thouyte what
enm	maner salutacioun this was.
enm	And it was don in the eiyte dai, thei
enm	camen to circumcide the child; and thei
enm	clepiden hym Zacarie, bi the name of

enm	schal purge his floor of corn, and
enm	schal gadere the whete in to his berne;
enm	but the chaffis he schal brenne with
enm	And he ledde hym in to Jerusalem, and
enm	sette hym on the pynacle of the temple,
enm	and seide to hym, If thou art Goddis
enm	sone, sende thi silf fro hennes doun;
enm	And Jhesus stood ouer hir, and
enm	comaundide to the feuer, and it lefte
enm	hir; and anoon sche roos vp, and
enm	And anoon he roos vp bifor hem, and
enm	took the bed in which he lay, and wente

enm	folewiden hym. And he resseyuede hem,
enm	and spak to hem of the kyngdom of God;

enm	and heele ye the sijke men that ben in

enm	And to this was a sistir, Marie bi

enm	of the Lord, and herde his word.
enm	And it was don, whanne he hadde seid
enm	these thingis, a womman of the cumpanye
enm	reride hir vois, and seide to hym,

enm	And the lord of the vyneyerd seide,

enm	And Jhesus seide to hym, Judas, `with a

enm	And whanne he knewe that he was of the

enm	seide to hym, Bifor that Filip clepide
enm	thee, whanne thou were vndur the fige

enm	And he cam to Jhesu bi niyt, and seide
enm	to hym, Rabi, we witen, that thou art
