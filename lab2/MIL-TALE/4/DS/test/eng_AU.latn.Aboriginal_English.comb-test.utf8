First of all, a long time ago, God made everything. He made everything that is in the sky, and he made everything that is on the earth. God made all the things that are everywhere.
When this all happened, there was night time and there was morning time. That was day number 5.
God put the man into the garden and gave him a job. He had to look after the garden and make sure all the plants grew strong and healthy.
The woman said, “That snake tricked me. That is why I ate that fruit.”
If you try to grow plants in the ground nothing will grow for you. You will go away from me. And you will walk around in lots of places, but you will have no home.”
Then Adam lived for another 800 years after Seth was born, and he had more sons and daughters.
He called his son Noah. Lamech said, “God cursed the ground. We have to work hard to dig the ground, but Noah will help us to be happy, even though we have to work hard.”
After that, God said to Noah, “You are the only man that lives the right way. Get your family and take them into the big boat.
Then, 6 weeks later, Noah opened the window in the top of the big boat. He wanted to find out if the water went down, and if a bird could find some dry ground.
And I promise this to all the animals that live on the earth, too, all the birds, and all the quiet animals, and all the wild animals. I promise this to all of the animals that came out of the big boat with you.
The people that came from Ham split up into different tribes. Each one had their own language, and their own land. Ham’s sons were Cush, and Egypt, and Put, and Canaan.
Those were all the families, and tribes, and nations that came from Shem. Each one had their own country and their own language.
Serug lived for 200 years after he had Nahor, and he had more sons and daughters.
So in that family there were 14 fathers from Abraham to David.
Eliud was the father of Eleazar.
He will really look after God’s people, Israel.’”
“People will say that God’s special person comes from Nazareth.”
So John baptised Jesus, and as Jesus came up out of the water the sky opened up, and Jesus saw the spirit of God coming down like a pigeon, and landing on him.
“It will happen in the land that belongs to the Zebulun tribe and the Naphtali tribe.
Some people never want to do bad things. These people will see God and they will be really happy.
But now I’m telling you this, husbands and wives have to stay married to each other. Only if a man’s wife sleeps with another man, as if he is her husband, only then can her proper husband divorce her. But if a wife never does that, her husband can’t divorce her. If he divorces her, he is forcing her to go and sleep with another man, and that is wrong. And if another man marries her, he is doing wrong too.”
Don’t be like them. God, your Father, knows what you need already, even before you ask him.
And don’t worry about how long you will live, or when you will die. No matter how much you worry about it you will not live any longer, not even one day longer.
So, to find out if a person is good or bad, look at what they do. A good person does good things. And a bad person does bad things.”
There was another man that was already a follower of Jesus. He said to Jesus, “Sir, I will come with you. But my father has died, so let me go home to bury him. After that, I will come with you.”
30-31 Well, you are more important to God than a big mob of those birds, so don’t be frightened. He knows you properly. He even knows how many hairs you have on your head. So he will only let things happen to you that will be good for you.”
Then Jesus said, “John the Baptiser is a very important man. He is greater than any other man that ever lived. But everyone in God’s family is more important than John the Baptiser.
He will not fight with anyone or shout at people.
The workers said, ‘Do you want us to go and pull up those weeds?’
Jesus and his followers went and stayed in the town called Capernaum. There were some men that worked in God’s ceremony house. Every year they collected the tax money that all the Jewish people had to pay to look after God’s ceremony house. Those men went to Peter and asked him, “Is your teacher going to pay the tax money for God’s ceremony house?”
Then the big boss got the worker to come in, and said to him, ‘You are really bad. You asked me to forget about all my money that you borrowed. It was millions of dollars. And I was good to you. I said you didn’t have to give it back to me.
Jesus talked to the Jewish leaders. He said, “Tell me what you think about this picture story. A man had 2 sons. He went to the oldest son and said, ‘Son, go and work on our farm today.’
So those 5 stupid ladies went to buy some oil. While they were away, that man came to the house to get married. The 5 other ladies were ready, and they went with him into the house, and somebody locked the door. Then they all started to eat the wedding dinner.
So we want to stop his followers, so that they can’t come and steal his body, and then tell everyone he got up alive again. If they do that, we’ll be worse off than before. So we want somebody to look after the cave that has his body, and guard it properly for 3 days.”
2-3 A long time before Jesus was born, God told a man called Isaiah to write about the things God was going to do for Jesus some time later. Isaiah wrote,
Like before, Jesus called out to James and John to stop their work and follow him. Straight away they left their father and the other workmen in the boat, and they followed Jesus.
But the man didn’t do what Jesus said. He went away and told everyone, “Jesus made me better.” After people heard the man’s story they came from everywhere. Lots of people came to Jesus. He couldn’t walk by himself in the towns any more. There were too many people. So he had to stay out in the bush. But people still came from everywhere and found him.
The Jewish law men saw Jesus’s followers eating those seeds, and those law men got upset. They growled at Jesus and said, “Your mob are doing the wrong thing. Our Jewish law says that today is the rest day. But your mob are getting seeds off those plants. That is work. They are breaking our law.”
– Matthew,
“You mob listen to me now. A man wanted to grow some seed food in a garden.
26-29 Jesus kept on teaching, and said, “I want you to know the way God’s family grows. This is another picture story. A man wanted to grow some seed food, so he threw some seeds on the ground. The seeds fell on the ground and after that the man walked away and left the seeds there. Those seeds grew all by themselves and that man didn’t know what made those seeds grow. He just left them there for many days and they grew. God made those seeds grow in the ground. At first the long stick part grew, and after that the head part grew with all the seeds inside it. At the right time God made the seeds get hard, ready for people to cut down those plants and pick up the seed food. God is boss for everyone and his family will grow just like the seeds in that story.”
The bad spirits asked Jesus, “Can we go into that big mob of pigs over there?”
Then Jesus told the people, “Stay away from this man’s house.” He only let a few people go with him. They were the girl’s father and mother, and Peter, and James and his young brother John. They were the only ones that went with him.
John’s friends heard this bad news. They came and got his body, then they took it away and buried it.
Night time came, and Jesus was still on the land all alone, and the boat was half-way across the lake.
‘If anyone rubbishes their father or mother, you have to kill that person.’
25-26 There was a Greek woman there. She came from a place called Phoenicia in Syria. Her daughter had a bad spirit inside her. So that woman went to Jesus to get help. She got down on her knees in front of Jesus, to show him respect, and she asked him to force the bad spirit out of her daughter.
Jesus was a little bit upset. He breathed deeply and said, “You mob that are alive today always want to see something powerful before you will believe that God sent me. Listen, I’m telling you straight, I will not do anything powerful for you mob here now.”
Jesus looked at the other followers there, then he said strongly to Peter, “Go away from me. You are like Satan. You are not thinking God’s way. You are just thinking like a man.”
Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has your boy been like this?”
Jesus also said to them, “God will let you have a little bit of trouble. He wants to test you to see if you are walking straight for Him.”
– Don’t tell lies about anybody.
So Jesus called them all together and said, “You know what government people are like here in this world. They like to be bosses over everybody. It is like that everywhere in this world, the leaders boss everyone around and the big bosses like to show everyone that they are strong.
12-13 The next morning Jesus and his followers started to walk from Bethany back to Jerusalem. Jesus saw a tree not far away. It was the kind of tree that gets fruit called figs. Jesus was hungry, so he went to look for some figs on that tree, but there was nothing. It had lots of leaves but no fruit. (It wasn’t the right time of the year yet for fruit.)
The owner sent another man to the garden, but the men hit him with whips too, and they hit him on the head.
Jesus said, “You mob have a problem. You don’t know God’s word properly and you don’t know about God’s power.
Then Jesus sat down near the money box at God’s house. He watched the people put money in the box to give it to God. Some rich people put in a lot of money
There will be a lot of people that will tell lies and say they are the special man from God called Christ, but they will be trying to trick you. Other people will tell lies and say they are talking God’s words, and they might do all kinds of clever things. These people will be thinking, ‘Maybe we can trick the people that God picked out for himself.’ But really, they can’t do that.
They heard him say this and they were very happy. They promised to pay him money. So Judas kept thinking about this and waited for the right time to help them catch Jesus.
Jesus and His followers came to the place called Gethsemane. He said to them, “I want you to sit here and wait for me. I’m going to pray to God.”
They said, “We heard this man say, ‘I will knock down God’s house and build another one in 3 days. Lots of men built this one, but I will build the new one just by myself.’”
9-11 Pilate knew that the leaders of the Jewish ceremonies were jealous of Jesus and that was why they brought him to Pilate. They wanted Pilate to kill him. So when those Jerusalem people asked Pilate to let one prisoner go, he said, “All right. How about I let Jesus go, this man you say is your big boss. What do you reckon?”
Some of the people standing around heard the words that Jesus said. They thought that he called out for Elijah to come to him from heaven.
Mary told them, “Jesus is alive again. I have just seen him.” But they didn’t believe her.
Zechariah saw the angel there and got a big shock. He was really frightened.
You see, God can do anything. Nothing is too hard for him.”
And he gave hungry people good food, and they ate till they were full.
God promised to save us from our enemies,
Joseph took Mary with him. She was his promised wife, and she was carrying a baby inside her at that time.
And he will get everyone to respect your people, the Israel nation.”
“God’s spirit came into me.
(We have not yet translated Luke 7:18-35. You can read those stories and messages in Matthew 11:1-19.)
But the people in that community said, “No. He is going to Jerusalem. We don’t like that Jerusalem mob, so he is not our friend. He can’t camp here tonight.”
‘You have to love the other people around you just as much as you love yourself.’”
Some of you are fathers. If your kid asks you for a fish to eat, will you give him a cheeky snake instead? No, of course not.
Then he said to the people, “Think carefully about this. Don’t be greedy. Don’t try to get more things than you need. You can’t get a long happy life from the things you own, even if you are rich.”
Then he put his hands on her, and straight away she stood up straight. She said, “Oh God, you are really good.”
There’s no way they can pay you for that feed. But God will make you real happy. On the day when God will make everyone alive again, at that time he will pay you properly for that good thing you did for those poor people.”
After he gets home he will call out to all his friends. He will say, ‘Hey, I’ve found my lost sheep. We can all be happy together now.’
The worker said, ‘Your brother just came back home, and your dad is having a party for him. We just killed a young bullock and cooked its meat. Your brother is alive and well, so your dad is really happy.’
And if you don’t handle other people’s things properly, God will not give you things for yourself.
So be careful.”
But first, before that happens, the people that are alive today will reckon they don’t want me to be their boss, and they will hurt me a lot.
I’m telling now, God listened to that bad man that was sorry, and God said he is all right. He went home feeling good. But God didn’t say that for the Pharisee, the man that reckoned he was real good. He didn’t go home feeling good.
Herod was very happy to see Jesus. You see, a long time before that day Herod heard about Jesus, so he always wanted to meet him. He wanted to see Jesus do something powerful.
Jesus asked him, “What things?”
Then Jesus asked them, “Have you got anything here for me to eat?”
Then Jesus’s followers left that place, the hill called Olive Trees, and they walked about a kilometre back
9-11 Some of us were born Jews and some of us became Jews later. We are from a lot of different countries, and we can hear them talking the languages of these countries. Some of us are from Parthia, and some from Media, and some from Elam, and some from Mesopotamia, and some from Judea, and some from Cappadocia, and some from Pontus, and some from Asia, and some from Phrygia, and some from Pamphylia, and some from Egypt, and some from places in Libya near Cyrene, and some of us are from Crete, and some of us are from Arabia, and some of us are visiting from Rome. But all of us can hear these people talking in our own languages. They are talking about the wonderful things that God does.”
You are close by my side and you look after me, so nobody can frighten me.
The people that believed in Jesus met together and shared all the things they had with each other all the time.
If anyone will not listen to him, that person will not belong to God’s people, and he will die.’
But Peter and John said to those leaders, “Do you think that God wants us to listen to you? Or do you think he wants us to listen to him, and do the things he says? What do you reckon? We know he wants us to do whatever he says,
As soon as Ananias heard Peter say that he fell down and died. A lot of people heard about what happened and they were frightened.
The soldiers brought the close followers of Jesus to the Jewish council men to talk to them. Then the big boss of the Jewish ceremonies growled at them and said,
God helped Stephen to be good to everybody, and he gave Stephen the power to do great things to show people that God was great.
That big boss tricked our family and was very hard on them. He made our mob throw their baby boys into the river to kill them.
So then they made a statue that looked like a baby cow. They brought money and things to it, and they had a big party to show respect to the thing they made.
Those men kept hitting Stephen with big stones. Then he called out, “Jesus, my leader, let my spirit come to be with you now.”
Philip saw him sitting in his wagon and he was reading God’s book. He was reading the part that God’s man, called Isaiah, wrote a long time ago.
But get up and go into the town. Somebody there will tell you what to do.”
There were some Jewish people in Jerusalem that talked the Greek language. Saul told them to believe in Jesus, but they argued with him. Then they got upset and tried to kill him.
He started feeling hungry and he wanted something to eat, but he waited and prayed while the people in the house were getting some food ready. Then Peter had like a dream, but he was still awake.
So right away I sent those men to bring you here. Thank you for coming. God can see us all here. We are ready to hear everything that he told you to say to us.”
Then I heard a voice say to me, ‘Get up Peter. Kill some of those animals and eat them.’
The Jewish leaders told Herod that they were happy for him to kill James, so Herod told his soldiers to grab Peter too. They grabbed him at the time for the Jewish people to have their ceremony where they ate flat damper.
There were some good Christians in the church in the town called Antioch. They were men that told God’s messages and taught God’s word to people. They were Barnabas, and Simeon (his other name was Niger), and Lucius from the land called Cyrene, and Manaen (he grew up with the big boss called Herod), and Saul.
Listen, friends. Some of you are Jews that belong to our grand-father Abraham’s family, and some of you are not Jews but you respect our God. All of you listen to this message that God sent to us. It is about the way God wants to save us.
So you people be careful. Don’t be like those people that God’s men wrote about.” That is the message that Paul told the people in that meeting in Antioch.
But somebody told Paul and Barnabas what they wanted to do, and then Paul and Barnabas tore their clothes to show them they were upset, and they ran into the crowd of people. They shouted,
He did the same thing for them that he did for us. They believed in him and he made them clean from the wrong things they did.
And the church leaders wrote a letter for them to take with them. They wrote this,
Paul kept going, and he came to the towns called Derbe and Lystra. A Christian man called Timothy lived there. Timothy’s mother was a Jew and she believed in Jesus too, but Timothy’s father was a Greek.
Later, in the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were praying aloud to God and saying that he is really good, and they were singing songs to God. The other prisoners were listening to them.
The Jews that lived in Berea were happy to listen to the message about Jesus and they thought about it carefully, not like the Jews in Thessalonica. The Berea people read God’s book every day to find out if Paul’s message was true.
1-2 After that Paul left Athens and he went to a town called Corinth.
After that Apollos said, “I want to go to Achaia country.”
That is the way the message about Jesus got very powerful, and a lot of people heard that message.
He visited all the Christians in the towns in Macedonia, and he told them a lot of things to help them be strong for Jesus.
And you know that I told you all of God’s message, everything that will help you. I didn’t keep anything secret. I taught you God’s message in places where everyone heard me, and I taught you in your homes too.
We left Tyre on that ship and went to a town called Ptolemais. There were Christians in that town too, so we went and said hello to them, and we stayed with them that night.
That’s what we wrote in our letter.”
The light was so bright that I fell down to the ground. Then I heard the voice of somebody talking to me from the sky. He said, ‘Saul. Saul. Why are you making trouble for me and hurting me?’
Paul said, “Yes, I am.”
Don’t do what they will ask you to do. There are more than 40 men that will hide beside that road and wait for Paul to come along, so they can grab him and kill him. They even promised God that they will not eat or drink anything until they kill Paul. They are ready right now. They are just waiting for you to agree to do what they want.”
If you ask him questions you will find out for yourself that everything we are telling you is true.”
Then they asked Festus, “Can you tell your soldiers to bring Paul to Jerusalem right now, and judge him here?” You see, they were going to secretly hide near the road and wait for Paul to come along, then jump up and kill him.
So I asked them, ‘What did he do?’ And I found out that he didn’t do anything bad, so we can’t kill him. But then he asked me to send him to Rome, for our biggest boss to judge him, so now I reckon I will send him to Rome.
And Paul said, “I told everyone this message, but some of the Jewish people didn’t like it, so they grabbed me and they tried to kill me. They did that in God’s ceremony house.
But after a little while, the wind changed, and a big strong wind blew across the island from the north side, and it pushed the ship to the south, away from the land. (That wind was called the Northeaster.)
Everyone ate as much as they wanted, then they threw the rest of the seed food out of the ship into the sea, and this made the ship a bit lighter.
After Paul was in Rome for 3 days, he sent a message to the Jewish leaders to come and talk with him. So they came, and Paul said to them, “My brothers, I didn’t do anything bad to our people, and I didn’t say anything bad about our Jewish culture. But our leaders in Jerusalem grabbed me, and they started to kill me. Then the boss of the Roman soldiers came and got me, and made me his prisoner.
He taught them the way that God takes people into his family, and he taught them all about our leader Jesus Christ. He wasn’t frightened of anyone, and nobody tried to stop him talking to people.
They didn’t want the wonderful God that never dies, but instead they made models of things that do die. They made things that look like people, or birds, or animals, or snakes or those kinds of things, and they respected those things. They didn’t respect God.
(The next part, 2:17—3:8, mainly talks to Jewish people, so we have not translated it yet.)
It is like this. We believe in Jesus, so God tells us, “You are all right now.” But if we only think about that law and try to do the things it says, God will not tell us that we are all right.
And that’s not all. Jesus Christ bled and died for us, so now God tells us, “You are all right,” and there is no way that he will get angry with us or punish us.
Actually you used to do bad things all the time but now you have made God your boss and you really want to do whatever he wants. I thank God for this.
I keep trying to do good things, but I can’t. No, I keep doing the bad things I don’t want to do.
But don’t worry about the trouble we get now. Later God will make everything so good for us that we will not even think about the trouble we get now.
“The message from God is very close to you
Or maybe God gave you the power to cheer people up, well this is your job. Or maybe he gave you the power to share your money and things with other people, well he wants you to share it with people that need things. Or maybe God gave you the power to be a leader, well you have to try to lead people properly. Or if God gave you the power to feel sorry for people that have troubles, and the power to be good to them, well this is his job for you, so be happy while you do it.
God’s law says, “Love other people just as much as you love yourself.” You know there are lots of other laws too, like, “Don’t sleep with people that you are not married to, as if they are they are your wives or husbands,” and, “Don’t murder anybody,” and, “Don’t steal anything,” and, “Don’t think about getting something for yourself if it belongs to somebody else.” But if you really love other people you will not do any of these wrong things anyway. So this law, that says to love people, it says what all the other laws put together are saying.
So don’t eat any meat, and don’t drink any wine if another Christian will get upset and go wrong if you do it.
and he picked me out to be a special worker for Jesus Christ. My job is to tell the good news about Jesus to you mob that are not Jews. Then God’s spirit works in you to make you good and right, and God is really happy with you. It is like I give you to God, like a really good present.
I’m sending this letter to you Christians there in the city called Corinth. God picked you to be his own special people and he joined you to Jesus Christ. You are in God’s family now, along with everyone that says to Jesus, “You are my leader.” He is their leader, and he is our leader too.
People might reckon that is a stupid thing for God to do, but God’s way is better than the best idea any human has ever had. And people might reckon that God is weak. He just let his son die. But those people are wrong. God did that to show us that he is stronger than anyone else.
These are the things that we tell you about. We don’t use words that smart people taught us, but we use the words that God’s spirit teaches us. And we explain God’s message to people that have God’s spirit living inside them.
“People reckon they are smart,
You see, some of you reckon you are really great, and you say, “Paul is frightened to come back here.”
Listen. You know what will happen to bad people, don’t you? They will not be in God’s family. They will never get the good things that God will give to his people in heaven. Don’t let anyone trick you about this. I’ll tell you now about the kind of people that will not be in God’s family. People that play around with somebody they are not married to, and sleep with them, they will not be in God’s family. Or 2 men that sleep together and do what is wrong, they will not be in God’s family. And people that respect other spirits more than they respect God,
But if she does leave him, she has to stay single. Or she can go back to her husband. And a husband has to stay with his wife.
But maybe another man and his promised girl, those 2 decide to work for God and not to get married, and maybe the man still wants to stay single and he can control himself. Well, he can stay single if he wants to. If he doesn’t get married, that is good.
You know, everyone that works gets some sort of pay for their work. You know about soldiers. They don’t have to buy their own food or their gear. And you know about gardeners. They work, and they always eat some of the food they grow. And it is the same for people that look after cows. They work, and they can drink some of the milk they get. You see, it’s right for people to work and then get something for it. So, if my work is to tell you about Jesus, it’s right for you to give me something for my work. But I never ask you to give me anything.
My friends, do you remember the story about my mob, the Israel people, a long time ago? They all followed Moses and walked out into the hot dry country, and God covered them all with a big cloud, and this cloud showed them where to go. Then they came to the Red Sea and God pushed the water back so that they all walked through the Red Sea on dry ground.
Don’t just think about yourself, and what is good for you, but think about what is good for other people.
It’s like this, God made the first woman by taking a part of the first man, but after that every man was born from a woman. But everything really comes from God.
And don’t come to that meeting hungry. If you are hungry, eat something at home before you come to the meeting, so when you meet together, you will not do wrong and God will not punish you.
But we don’t need to cover the beautiful parts of our bodies. God has joined all these parts together to make one body. We might think some parts are not important, but God has made them really important.
You know, I talked to you already about the special power that God gives to his people, and now I’m telling you that one day we will stop using that special power. But we can’t stop loving people. If you love somebody properly you will always love them. But the time will come when God will not need to give us special power any more. When that time comes God will not tell some people his special messages, and God will not get some people to talk in special languages, and God will not let some people know special things.
You see, it is like this. If I pray in a special language, I’m not using my mind. I’m not thinking about my words while I pray. Only my spirit is praying.
Maybe you think I’m wrong, but remember this, you don’t know everything in God’s word. It didn’t start with you, and you are not the only people that ever heard it.
Listen, this is the true story. Jesus Christ died, and God made him alive again. Jesus was the first person to die and then come back to life again, and to live for ever.
Every kind of thing that is alive has a different kind of body from every other kind of thing. People have one kind of body. Animals have a different kind of body. Birds have another kind of body, and fish have another kind of body.
Do it like this. On the 1st day of every week, each of you can pick out some of the money that you got that week, and keep it in a separate place. I will come to you soon, and you will have this money ready for me. You will not have to quickly look around and try to find it when I get there.
From Paul
3-4 You see, Titus was there with me, and he is a Greek man, not a Jew. But there were some Jewish men that came secretly into the church in Jerusalem. They reckoned they believed in Jesus, but they didn’t really trust him properly. They only came into the church to see what we were doing. And they reckoned that Titus had to follow the Jewish law and have a young man’s operation. But, you see, if we belong to Jesus Christ we are free from that law. But those men wanted to force us to keep that law.
So God will be good to everyone that believes him, just like he was good to Abraham when Abraham believed God.
And when we became God’s kids he sent his son’s spirit to live right inside us. His spirit in us gets us to call out to God, “My Dad, you are my father.”
“Be happy, you woman that hasn’t got any kids.
You see, it is like this. We all have a bad part in us that makes us want to do bad things, to make us feel good. And we also have God’s spirit in us, and he makes us want to do good things. These 2 are both in you, and they both want to control you, so they are fighting each other inside you all the time. Whenever you listen to God’s spirit and try to do I good things, that bad part in you tries to stop you, so you don’t do what you really want to do.
You see, it doesn’t matter whether anyone did a young man’s operation on you, or not. The most important thing is this. God changed you into a new person.
God is very powerful.
I know you heard about what God did. He is very good to you, and he picked me to tell you his message.
You see, Jesus Christ has been good to us. He has given us each a spiritual gift. He gives each one of us the spiritual power to do something properly. He himself picks the one to get each gift.
And don’t swear, or say anything that is bad. But say good things that will help people, and make them stronger. In this way your words will be good for those that hear you.
Don’t get drunk. If you drink too much grog you will go wild and stupid. Don’t do that, but instead, let the Holy Spirit keep on filling you up.
Now I’m talking to bosses. You have to do the same, you have to be good to your workers. Don’t say anything to frighten them. Don’t tell them you want to punish them. Remember that God in heaven is your boss, and he is the boss of your workers too. And he treats everyone the same, no matter whether you are a boss or a worker.
Yes, I love you, just like Jesus Christ loves you, and I want to be with you again. God himself knows this is true.
3-4 Each of you has to think about what is good for the others. Don’t only think about what is good for yourself. Don’t think that you are better than other people, but think that they are better than you. And don’t do things only to get people to say you are good. Don’t try to be a boss over other people, but let others be boss over you.
Yes, you can be happy too, even if they kill me. You can be happy with me.
And all of us have to think like this if we are spiritually strong now and live properly for Jesus. But if you think differently about anything, God will help you and show you which way is right.
But right now I have everything I need, and even more than I need. You gave all these things to Epaphroditus to bring to me, and I’m happy to get them. But you didn’t only give them to me. You gave them to God. You gave him the right sort of present, a really nice one, and it has made him very happy.
But God got Jesus Christ to live in a human body and then die, so that now you can come back to God and be his friends. God did this so that later, at the time when God will judge everyone, he will see that you are properly good and clean inside, and he will not blame you. He will say that you are not guilty.
They are trying to have a church without Jesus.
And now I am talking to you fathers. Don’t be rough on your children. Don’t make them get angry with you, or they might stop trying to be good.
From Paul
And friends, do you know what happened to the people in the churches in Judea country? They believed in Jesus and their Jewish countrymen gave them a lot of trouble. And it is the same for you now. You believe in Jesus and your countrymen give you a lot of trouble. That Jewish mob didn’t want to believe God, and they made trouble for Jesus too.
None of you men can ever sleep with a woman that is not your own wife. If you do that, you are taking something that belongs to another man. He is like your brother, but you are doing a bad thing to him. And God will punish you if you do things like that. We told you this when we were with you, and we mean it.
They work for God, so respect them and love them very much.
Our Christian friends, we know you are learning to trust God more and more, and you are loving each other more and more. So we have to thank God for you all the time.
So then, friends, you have to keep strong and keep on properly trusting Jesus. Keep on believing the things that we taught you. You see, Jesus taught us those things, and later we taught them to you. We told you those things when we were there with you, and after that we wrote letters to you to tell you more. Keep on believing those things.
3-4 Do you remember the time that we were in Ephesus, and I got up to go to Macedonia? At that time I wanted you to straighten out those people in Ephesus that teach the wrong message, so I told you to stay there. Those people think a lot about old time stories that are not true, and they think about the lists of names of people in their family. Then from there they teach people lies. People that listen to them just get into useless arguments. People shouldn’t do that, but they have to learn about God and the way he works. They have to learn to believe in God and to do whatever he wants. So I want you to tell those lying teachers to stop teaching those wrong things.
And in your meetings, I want the women to dress properly and sensibly. They can’t dress in a way that makes men look at them. They can’t think about the fancy clothes they will wear, or their fancy hairdo, or the jewels that they want to wear, like gold or pearls. Those things are not important.
– They can’t be greedy, wanting lots of money and things.
8-9 You sometimes hear people say, “If we train our bodies we will get fit to play sport and we will live better lives now, and that is a little bit good for us. But if we train our spirits to respect God and take notice of him we will not only live better lives now but we will live a lot better in the life that will come after we die, just like God promised us. That is a lot better for us.” If people tell this message they tell a true story, and everybody has to follow that word.
God says, “You have to pay the worker for his work.” God gives us an example of this in his law. We read in God’s book, “If you get an animal to work for you, you have to let that animal eat something when it works.” Well, it is like that too with the church leaders. They work for the church, so the church has to pay them properly.
All right, Timothy, God gave you his good news, so you have to look after it properly. Make sure nobody changes it around. There are some people that have big discussions but say bad things about God. Don’t listen to them. They might reckon they know all about it and they might say that you are wrong, but really, they are the ones that are wrong.
And you are also like a sportsman. You know that sportsmen have to follow the rules of their sport, otherwise they can’t win. Well, just like that, you have to follow the rules that God set down, so that in the end you will win and he will give you the prize.
Most people will only love themselves, and money. They will think that they are smart and they will tell everyone they are smart. They will say bad things about other people. They will never do what their parents tell them to do. They will never thank anyone for anything. They will not respect things that are belong to God.
10-12 Almost all my friends went away to somewhere else. Demas just likes to have fun with the things that are around these days so he left me and went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia country, and Titus went to Dalmatia country. And I told Tychicus to go to Ephesus. Only Luke is here with me now. If Mark was here he could help me a lot in my work, so get him and bring him with you.
– don’t pick people that drink a lot of grog,
Then the old women can teach the young women to love their husbands and their kids,
And Titus, you know the lawyer called Zenas and his mate called Apollos. Those 2 men will be leaving your place soon to go on a trip. Please help them as much as you can. Make sure they have everything they need for their trip.
This is me, Paul, writing this with my own hand so you can be sure I mean it, I will pay that money back to you. But remember you already got a lot from me. I told you about Jesus and he gave you real life.
My dear friends, you have to be ready to listen to other people, and you have to stop and think before you say anything yourself. Stop and think before you get angry, too.
Maybe you reckon, “Some people can believe in Jesus and other people can do the good things that Jesus says to do.” I answer like this, “You can’t show me that you believe in Jesus if you don’t do the things he says. But whenever I do the good things he tells me to do I show you that I do believe in him.”
– We are fair to everybody. We don’t treat some people good and other people like rubbish.
5-6 While you lived here on this earth you killed good people that couldn’t fight back. You lied and said they were guilty and then you killed them. While you were doing that you got everything you wanted and had plenty to eat. You are fat now, but look out. God will kill you. Think about a farmer and his cow. He feeds that cow a lot of grass and makes it fat, then he kills it to get some meat. Well that is a picture of you. You are fat now, but God will kill you.
You are trusting God and he is saving you, so you are really happy. You are so happy you can’t properly say how happy you are.
You see, you already found out that Jesus Christ is really good.
Some of you are working men. You belong to your bosses. Maybe your boss is good to you, or maybe your boss is rough on you. It doesn’t matter. You have to listen carefully to your boss anyway and do whatever he tells you. Sometimes you do nothing wrong, but your boss makes trouble for you or hits you because you are following Jesus. You have to respect him anyway and take it quietly. Don’t try to pay him back.
Don’t make trouble.
God has given each one of you a different way to do good for each other. He has given you the power to do it, so you have to do it properly.
God loves you and he is looking after you, so tell him about everything that makes you sad, or angry, or worried, and trust him to look after you properly.
But while I’m still alive in this body I will do everything I can to keep telling you these things so that after I die you will always remember them.
Suppose these people never knew the right way. If that is true, God will not punish them very much. But that is not true. They did know the right way and then they turned back and went the wrong way, so God will really punish them a lot.
God is very good to you, and I pray that he will keep being good to you more and more. I pray that he will keep feeling sorry for you, and help you be really happy and quiet inside yourselves. And I pray that he will keep loving you very much.
He is the only God. He gets our leader, Jesus Christ, to save us. So everyone has to always thank him and remember how great he is. He has all power. Everything has to do whatever he says. He always had this power. He had it right from the start of time. And he will have all this power for ever. This is true.
'A bit of a shame' because, even though the public finance situation in the Member States is complicated, we should have done everything in our power to reinvest the revenue collected for the benefit of, for example, trans-European transport network (TEN-T) priority projects.
- The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A joint statement by the European Parliament and the Council. 'The European Parliament and the Council are mindful of the importance of providing accurate information to consumers, in particular, when products are marketed with an indication of origin so as to protect them against fraudulent, inaccurate or misleading claims.
Above all, EU policy should be measured by the progress made in improving the well-being of Europeans.
According to future estimates relating to employability and required diplomas, there are allegedly 15.6 million new jobs within the EU for graduates and 3.7 million for those with a secondary education qualification (source: Cedefop). On the other hand, 12 million jobs are going to be cut for those with a lower level of qualification!
According to the target set in 2002, EU Member States must offer early years education to 90% of children between the age of three and the compulsory school age.
Admittedly, this text is far less ambitious than the initial proposal, but it will enable us for the first time to implement the 'polluter pays' principle and to internalise external transport costs such as noise and CO2 emissions.
After five years, we will know whether it is working and then this credit rating foundation will also have to pay back the funds that it has received.
Agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
All of this goes towards underlining the need to protect European businesses and the fact that there can be no growth and development, and above all no jobs, in a social and market economy situation in which the market - which is also a fundamental instrument of our European Union - does not pursue a higher and more important goal, namely social policy.
All this must be viewed from the sustainability standpoint you have been talking about, as well as from the environmental and social standpoints, but must also be viewed from the other side, which is also important: that is, the human side, for fishers who are suffering enormously.
Also of interest is the idea of bringing the timing of the MMF into line with the political cycles of EU bodies, thereby increasing democratic control and accountability.
Although it is expected that South Sudan will apply for accession to the Cotonou Agreement, the 10th European Development Fund will not be available until sometime after accession to the agreement.
Although the directive should not allow discrimination based on the haulier's nationality, Article 7k permits Member States which introduce a system for charging tolls and/or users of the infrastructure to offer suitable compensation for these charges, which may distort competition.
Amendment of Rule 51: joint committee meetings (
An announcement today in that direction would certainly be helpful for Egypt and for the Egyptians.
And lastly, I find it important to mention the importance of a deep understanding of cultural heritage, so that communities living together can recognise and respect each other's cultural values. I believe that the concrete task of the Commission is to promote all of these issues, while that of Parliament is to strengthen theoretical and political support.
Another important element is the strengthening of development based on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort, if not destroy, these relations.
Approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement (
As I have already explained, all the matters discussed at that time are linked to national competence.
As a Bulgarian politician, I am following with particular interest the developments concerning the intermediate category of beneficiary regions, which is planned to be created in the new 2013-2020 budget framework.
As a result of the provision on revision the co-legislators can make informed decisions because the Commission will conduct an in-depth survey on further compulsory labelling requirements.
As an example, as Mr Audy reminded us, we have already implemented three concrete simplification measures for FP7: more use of average personnel costs, easier procedures for owner-managers of SMEs, and a clearing committee to ensure a common interpretation of the rules.
As far as the radio spectrum is concerned, our policy must have realistic yet ambitious objectives so that European companies are able to compete in the world market on a sounder footing.
As if that were not enough, the rivalries between the tribes and armed groups in South Sudan are also on the rise, and observers estimate that more than a thousand people have already lost their lives since January.
As part of the mechanism for cooperation in the area of nuclear safety, we are considering a project aimed at helping the most significantly affected population groups around the Chernobyl exclusion zone.
As regards the 2012 budget, I would like to point out that the draft budget that was adopted by the Commission on 20 April is in line with the European Council conclusions of 24 and 25 March, which state that fiscal consolidation efforts must be complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms.
As someone who, for many years, worked as a journalist and has a thorough knowledge of the job, this matter is of particular importance to me. In Azerbaijan, journalists are constantly hindered from fulfilling their basic role - the reliable and credible provision of information.
As such, the MFF needs to have the financial backing to match the ambition and commitment of the Europe 2020 strategy.
As the primary role of the IMF is to work on conditional structural reform packages to accompany the distribution of funds to members when they are in dire straits, I believe that Ms Lagarde has shown that she is well able to broker complex agreements on controversial issues, successfully bringing together disparate parties to reach a beneficial solution.
As we approach a new stage of EU enlargement, the MFF must provide for properly balanced expenditure.
As with Mr Lyon's report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo's report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ...
Aside from what has already been said about the precautionary principle and essential traceability - the first point - it is also a question of knowing how this general alert singling out Spanish cucumbers for blame could have been issued without any, or hardly any, proof.
At a time when the EU has already understood that greater coordination of economic policy and greater control of budgetary policy are both necessary, the idea that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should support economic governance seems an extremely relevant one to me.
At present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from countries outside the EU, mainly Russia.
At the present time, attention is mainly paid to implementation of the EU Action Plan for 2009-2012, which is aimed at strengthening European cooperation in the struggle against the unacceptable consequences of drug addiction. I would like to see the Centre working not only on the consequences but also on the causes of drug addiction, thus solving the problem at an early stage. I voted in favour.
At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market.
At the same time, this method also enables the Member States to generate resources to reinvest in the transport system in order to make it more sustainable so as to actually reduce these external costs.
At times of crisis, investment is needed in jobs and development.
Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out.
Because of Lisbon, investment treaties can become an instrument for the Commission's political objectives - and not just the Commission's: we can be absolutely sure that the Greens will try to advance their political programme, and we have seen that in the trade treaties time after time.
Better use can be made of the forest in this fight, not only through preventing felling, but also through afforestation and reforestation programmes.
Both sides are also significant investors in each other's economy, with a combined volume of Foreign Direct Investment worth EUR 200 billion in 2009.
Businesses in Europe must remain competitive.
But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a number of issues: first of all, the fact that there are some diverse standards; secondly, the long time that it takes from the time of application to actual registration.
By 'European family', I mean the overseas countries and territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part.
By giving children the ability to realise their potential, quality education and care structures can contribute significantly to achieving two of the major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy: reducing early school drop-out rates below 10% and lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion.
By the way, temporary border controls were introduced on the basis of the Schengen regime of 2006 for the European Football Championship and for the football World Cup as a defence against hooliganism.
Canada is one of the EU's oldest and closest partners, being the first industrialised country with which - in 1976 - the EU signed a Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market, and to opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers.
Cohesion policy after 2013 should continue to be an important factor in the development of Europe.
Commissioner Malmström, leave Schengen as it is. Re-read the Treaties, re-read Articles 67 and 78. Everything is there.
Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation.
Consensus was also reached on the issue of transparency, since I support the idea to oblige all registered rating agencies to conduct an annual review to assess their past credit rating performances, with this information then being passed on to the supervisor.
Considering the significant economic returns from such programmes, I voted in favour of the Remek report which calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure sufficient funding in order to make sure these projects are completed by 2018, thus asserting themselves as credible challengers to the American system.
Cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy (short presentation)
Countries that fail to meet the obligations in the preventive and corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact may be subject, unless they take appropriate measures (the suitability of which will be decided by the Council) and present a rebalancing plan, to the application of financial sanctions equal to 0.1% of GDP.
Crucial elements in that policy would be support for the work of the UN and a clarification of the EU's policy with regard to the UN.
Cutting expenses hurts, but remains the only way back to growth and stability.
Despite already being the object of resolutions of this Parliament, the last of which was in 2010, the old request that the country of origin be marked and that information be made available about the origin of various goods has been postponed, which we regret.
Despite the ongoing fighting and its spread to various parts of Libya, humanitarian organisations are doing a remarkable job in preventing a major humanitarian disaster.
Disselkoen has once again paid a large amount of money as bail and is back in the Netherlands, but his case shows that the European Arrest Warrant may lead to degrading situations.
Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding 'No'. Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion.
During the debate, one of our fellow Members said that letting Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen would be a childish decision. I totally disagree. I believe that when we become adults, we appreciate rational arguments, and if we have been well educated, we recognise when rational arguments are fair.
Earlier, we discussed Mr Coelho's report and the need to safeguard Schengen as one of the most beautiful achievements of the European Union.
Either these countries will look only to China or to Russia, or they will at least have a chance to look towards Europe. I believe that this is important.
Environmental protection is one of the European Union's priorities.
Europe must be involved here at an earlier stage. I do not believe that we have learnt the right lessons from the crises of the 1990s.
European Investment Bank, European Commission, we are actually asking for an investigation into the activities of the European Investment Bank towards the end of September this year so that we can start the next discharge procedure with proper documentation.
European regulation of the issue which you are rightly complaining about on the basis of practical experience was not wanted at the time.
Even now, the majority of Indian foreign investment is situated in the European Union and the Tata Group alone is a leading employer in the industrial sector in Great Britain.
Every country should have the right to focus on the concerns of its citizens, including food security, the environment, reservations about genetic modification and the needs of rural areas, in order to support sustainable agriculture in Europe.
Experience shows that in many cases, project ideas emerge on the basis of available funding, instead of being based on real needs and on strategic priorities.
Finally it is also aimed at incorporating within international negotiations the rights of workers, which the International Labour Organisation is tasked with defending, as well as promoting a global economic governance that takes these parameters into account.
Finally, I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive.
Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union.
Finally, my other question relates to the timing, and you spoke about the difficulty with the Commission and the budgetary authority.
Finally, we do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes.
First of all, I would like express my sincerest gratitude to Baroness Ashton for the EU's full support to Estonia in trying to resolve the hostage crisis in Lebanon.
Firstly that Objective 1 funds, for the convergence regions, not be reduced - I would even like to see them increased - by the savings made as a result of certain regions no longer being under Objective 1. These savings must benefit the new intermediary regions of course, but also the other regions.
Firstly, the Commission, Member States and their organisations must provide consumers with information upstream.
Fishermen's incomes are also dependent on the price of oil.
Following the positive results of the evaluations and follow-up visits by teams of experts, it can be concluded that although some issues remain outstanding and regular reports and future follow-up visits are being demanded, these do not constitute an obstacle to the full accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area.
For example, EUR 34 billion left the six Irish domestic banks in the last three months of 2010, forcing them to rely on what is supposedly short-term funding from the ECB to the tune of EUR 160 billion.
For example, we need a clear definition of whistleblowing, we need whistleblowers to have a right to be heard, we need independent points of contact that can provide information on rights, obligations and options, and not least we also need precise handling deadlines for the competent EU institutions.
For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action, and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union's existence.
For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen.
For their part, entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to offer new quality services, which will stimulate the development of the common European economy.
For this reason, Member States should ensure that vocational education and training is better adjusted to the needs of the labour market, and that vocational education provides employees with the skills needed to take up new, sustainable jobs that will be created in the future sustainable economy. I consider the role of local governments, entrepreneurial partnerships and educational institutions important in the development of the labour market demands of vocational education and training.
For us, if the European Union is to progress, it needs to develop a policy based on principles of peace, detached from military means and interventions, and to promote the demilitarisation of international relations.
Fourthly, in addition to all the cultural, social, religious and foreign policy concerns, the accession of Turkey would place a massive burden on the Cohesion Fund.
From the Lithuanian border, it will be possible to see the chimneys of one of these power plants just as clearly as we can we the tower of Strasbourg Cathedral from Parliament.
Further there will be a prohibition of so called pre-ticked boxes causing problems especially in the passenger travel sector.
Furthermore, entrepreneurs, managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the creative sector, need better access to financing opportunities, because we currently have too little know-how and too little access to bank finance.
Furthermore, owing to the European Union's high degree of dependency on imports from third countries (60%), producers have very little or even no influence on the price levels of fisheries products. I agree that the ceiling on de minimis aid should be raised from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm for a transitional period of three years, while ensuring that environmental and social sustainability are not undermined and that competition between Member States is not distorted.
Furthermore, the way in which this approach penalises the geographically more peripheral Member States, countries of origin, departure or destination of goods, for the benefit of 'central' and transit countries, is unacceptable.
Georgia has practically eliminated the cancer of corruption in state institutions and the civil service by means of a series of public sector reforms (concerning the public prosecutor's office, the judiciary and the police) and political reforms.
Given that the main economic activities in Seychelles are fishing and tourism, and that this agreement benefits both the EU and the Republic of Seychelles, in view of the creation of 3 000 jobs in Seychelles and 760 in Europe and the monitoring of catches through a multiannual sectoral programme which provides for scientific cooperation and the promotion of responsible and sustainable fisheries, I am voting in favour of this proposal for a recommendation.
Given the results of the referendum, the will of the people of South Sudan is now unequivocally in favour of independence, as has been repeatedly reiterated for many years now.
Greater consistency is needed in EU development aid and cooperation policy, particularly with regard to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
Has a reform in your criminal justice system been considered so that prosecutors have some discretion as to whether to issue an arrest warrant and do not have to pursue every single complaint? In that way, the famous small offences like the stolen piglet would not be so much of a problem.
He has all the requisites for being an excellent President of the European Central Bank.
Here is a country that has not really moved forward in terms of political rights since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Honourable Members, I hope that the avenues and initiatives I have indicated will be followed up with effective action within the Member States.
How should we classify the middle-class protests in the Arab countries? The underlying causes are both political and economic.
However, I am not here to discuss what should be agreed among competent Members of the Commission and the International Monetary Fund with the participation of the Greek authorities.
However, I regret the shortcomings in the management of the fixed assets' inventory identified by the Court of Auditors but note the Agency's assurance that this will be remedied in the 2010 accounts; considers that uncertainty about the location of fixed assets is another illustration of the problems and additional costs arising from using two sites.
However, I would like us to establish more precisely what overall cost savings the Union will achieve as a result of environmental improvements and to present these figures.
However, as regards trade relations between the European Union and third countries, there remain profound differences in terms of social protection systems, as well as of working conditions.
However, for formal reasons, we must ensure that those businesses which are affected are involved in an appropriate way and, therefore, we need the time to do this.
However, in order to ensure regional cooperation does not serve merely as an excuse to delay decisions, we have added a whole raft of requirements which such cooperation should meet.
However, it is essential to put theory into practice, especially when it comes to mobilising enough financial resources through Union support programmes and measures to enable the monitoring of forests' ecological and phytosanitary state and, wherever necessary, their reclassification, including reforestation.
However, more needs to be done to make improvements in this area and it is for this reason that I supported this report.
However, that must be the subject of proper legal proceedings.
However, the debate has only just become public, with the result that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately informed. I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information. I consider the project to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more about European development - otherwise there will be more and more Eurosceptics.
However, the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to 'create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop and grow', adding that 'to grow, they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments'. It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely 'to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it'. In other words, what the report does is put education and training fully at the beck and call of European capitalism.
However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe's major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy.
However, this report has enabled us to verify that measures that can be taken within the framework of international trade probably cannot be dealt with as urgently as these acts require, so we should learn for the future.
However, we cannot fail to point out some doubts that remain - arising from other fisheries partnership agreements - about the effectiveness of the stated objectives of cooperation on sustainable development in the sector for the third country in question, and on the sustainability and monitoring of their fishing activities.
However, we still have a lot to do to make life easier for SMEs with respect to the red tape they are faced with and access to funding that is often difficult.
Hungarians also have the right to adopt a constitution which makes no mention of an ombudsman or a personal data representative.
I also appeal from this Chamber to the football authorities in Romania to reverse this decision and allow Politehnica Timişoara to remain in top-flight Romanian and European football.
I am calling for a little more flexibility for the Member States. I am also calling for the Commission to analyse my request thoroughly and to understand the concerns of an entire sector, which must be preserved and developed.
I am in favour of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area. A detailed and objective assessment of both countries' compliance with the Schengen acquis has been completed.
I am sorry if there is a false impression about the Commission's views on Schengen. I do not think I have spoken about anything other than Schengen for the last month! I have emphasised how important Schengen is, what a gift it is to the European Union and that we must strengthen it and not weaken it.
I am voting for this proposal, given that the report has achieved a balanced approach between the most important issues for the organisation and the activities of the European External Action Service, and for the key areas of security and defence policy.
I am voting in favour of this resolution, which relates to a chapter of the European commercial policy that should be taken as a model for negotiations with other countries - including India, China and Pakistan - which certainly do not guarantee fair competition, let alone respect for social rights and environmental standards, as Canada does.
I believe that the example shown by the aerospace industry in Northern Ireland is a significant one - larger companies mentoring and helping smaller companies to actually access the programme - and I would use this opportunity to call upon the Commissioner to provide us with radical and new ways for small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from this very important programme.
I can only be in favour of the choice to put Mario Draghi forward as the new President of the European Central Bank (ECB) for an eight-year term beginning next November.
I do not agree with the proposal to charge heavy goods vehicles according to air and noise pollution. I feel that it would be inappropriate to create yet another additional tax burden for hauliers, who have been badly affected by the financial crisis.
I fail to see how, with a reduced budget, we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener, a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this.
I have finished my four minutes and I want to keep some time for the end of this debate, so I would just like to end by saying that in this time of austerity and times of economic difficulties, we must make sure that early years is still on the agenda and we still do what needs to be done in this important area.
I have voted in favour of the agreement as it is intended to ensure that trade takes place with a high level of customs security and that a set of standards ever closer to the EU acquis is applied.
I move on now to explain my vote on the Directive on Consumer Rights. I welcome the adoption of this directive, which constitutes a step forward in European integration and in the protection of consumer rights but, at the same time, I regret that the adoption of a number of articles of the directive involves taking protection away from many Spanish consumers and users who are going to find themselves deprived of certain rights that were already enshrined in Spanish law.
I served four terms as a member of parliament for a region, one area of which, namely Naoussa, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the whole of Europe, as a result of the impact of globalisation of the textile industry.
I still believe that some sort of European Arrest Warrant is a necessary tool to fight crime and terrorism across the Union, particularly given the huge free movement of people now moving between Member States, including - sadly - criminals. I also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small - but still too many.
I support this report, which calls on the Member States to ensure that people, at different times of life, have access to vocational education and training which is tailored to their needs that will facilitate and improve their participation in the labour market and in society more generally.
I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States' discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution.
I think that accession to the Schengen area is not a gift being offered to Romania, but rather recognition of its merits and efforts, and will be an obvious asset to the security of the EU's external borders.
I view the assessment made by the Court of Auditors in these special reports positively, because it is through these reports that we are able to access more clearly the information relating to how funds are spent, and also the need to reassess or adapt programmes and projects.
I voted against this report, which draws cultural goods into a logic of the market and competition.
I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future, because it tables proposals that respond to new challenges like food security, environmental protection and climate change, whilst simultaneously ensuring greater territorial balance in Europe's rural areas.
I voted for this report because the committee responsible considers that, in giving the interview in question, Luigi de Magistris was acting in the performance of his duties as Member of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents.
I voted for this resolution which urges the Commission to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible, notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the SESAR Joint Undertaking because that recently formed undertaking has convinced the Court of Auditors of its reliability.
I voted in favour of the draft Council Regulation concerning the extension of the scope of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash between euro area Member States. I voted in favour of it because I consider that extending the scope of the regulation is necessary and will resolve problems relating to the safety of the personnel responsible for transportation.
I voted in favour of the report on the creation of a European law of contract for consumers and businesses which will help to facilitate cross-border transactions and strengthen the Internal Market, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 86/415/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the installation, location, operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is very important to continuously improve the quality of EU law making, and this report sets out concrete proposals for improving the law making process both within the European Parliament and the Commission.
I voted in favour of this report to enable the transformation of a report which is all too often about exploitation and the law, in an area which represents between 5 and 9% of all jobs within the European Union.
I voted to give discharge to Eurojust and congratulate the agency for establishing measures to estimate the market value of relevant products/services before commencing a procurement procedure. I consider this initiative an important practice to be followed by other agencies. I welcome, in addition, the agency's annual procurement plan for 2009 which greatly helped Eurojust's units and services in the management of their tenders. I consider that these initiatives improve the authorising officer's guidance and control.
I want to inform the Commission and the Council that this is the start of Parliament's campaign to win new rights for our citizens who are the victims of fraud.
I welcome the Commission communication on the SBA review as it deals, to a large extent, with the problems which SMEs are faced with and for which European and national policies will have to come up with a solution.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, as I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome your statement today on Bosnia and Herzegovina - that was a fine statement, but you have failed to appoint a head for the delegation in Sarajevo.
I would add that Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation does not exclude domestic workers, so no amendment is needed for the ratification of the ILO Convention.
I would congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which has resulted in a report enabling us to start drawing up the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period, which constitutes a challenge for the Commission and for the Council.
I would like to give Mr Oettinger my support and encourage him to submit an ambitious proposal on the subject of energy efficiency in two weeks. I am very happy with the parts that we already know about, which are a mix of incentives and obligations for those affected. I do not like the fact that the Member States are supposed to set their own goals.
I would like to take up the subject once again of what is wrong in Greece, because I think that Mr Daul has a responsibility towards Nea Dimokratia.
I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result that has just been achieved due to an effort at finding a compromise between all the groups in an ambitious and encouraging report.
If a 28th regime procedure is going to be instituted, in keeping with this report, this would facilitate cross-border credit-based transactions.
If not, your conscience and this Chamber will hold you to account.
If the costs of the umpteenth strategy will still only finance talk, I call on the European institutions to make amends to the dozens of small entrepreneurs in my region, Veneto, who have taken their lives rather than see their small businesses fail.
If they are to enjoy uninterrupted connection, they must have radio frequencies dedicated entirely to them.
If we can get free elections and a new government in place, the European Union, in conjunction with other international bodies, particularly the African Union, can help nurture this country along on the road to democracy and the road to economic recovery.
If we really want these delegations to prevent development money ending up in the wrong hands or to prevent money leaking away into failing projects, then EU delegations will need more staff.
If you had been listening you would have heard that it fell.
Impact assessments are a key instrument for the legislative process, and one of which European legislators should make greater use in future, as they show the possible consequences of their policy options.
In 2004, when the Erasmus Mundus exchange programme was launched, with the help of a large majority in this Parliament, I got the European Commission to agree to take the necessary measures to ensure quality in this programme. A 'European Quality Charter for Mobility' was even created.
In Europe, there are contractual forms that affect immigrants and women in this area of domestic service which are very precarious and contain major loopholes.
In a changing world, our Union needs to be more than a purely economic Union.
In accordance with the EU guidelines on the death penalty, we are exerting strong pressure on the United States to abolish the death penalty at a national level, and at the level of the US federal states, and we are calling for a pardon in individual cases.
In addition, allowance has been made for the possibility of a certain dependence of tolls on vehicle movement (road congestion) at peak hours - for a maximum, however, of five hours a day. I think that this solution will successfully encourage avoidance of the use of some sections of road during peak hours.
In addition, the young generation needs a consistent strategy on mobility for increasing development in the area of science and culture. I support measures for cultural diplomacy, which can also be helped by the work of parliamentary delegations.
In any case, we had a tough struggle.
In connection with the evacuation drill which took place during voting time, today, all explanations of positions adopted at today's vote will be heard tomorrow - they will be heard together with tomorrow's explanations of vote.
In fact, I have a lot of faith in that.
In fact, the directives entail a substantial increase in EU interference in the internal economic affairs of Member States, which suggests a sharp decline in the latter's influence.
In its most recent report on these matters (February 2011), the Commission stated that Bulgaria needed to improve further the way the judiciary, police and other investigative bodies are structured, managed and cooperate.
In my country and throughout Europe, there are families who struggle to feed and educate their children and do not even consider having a computer, never mind high speed broadband.
In my opinion, the area where there is greatest room for improvement is in public awareness. I think it is inadequate and irresponsible to inform citizens on a given day about which food they should not buy or which food looks suspicious.
In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public.
In order to address and resolve this problem, Mrs Reding plans to issue a communication by the end of the year which will report on the status of the implementation of the existing directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising and on the current opportunities for revising it and which will provide an evaluation of the situation.
In order to meet citizens' needs, Parliament has proposed to create, in the context of the Structural Funds, a new category of regions where GDP per capita is between 75% and 90% of the Union's GDP.
In other words, the people should not interfere in the machinations of a process of which they are the victims. I will never allow the Commission to attack France. I am voting against this report.
In particular, I would like to stress the necessity of conducting a review of existing programmes with a cultural component and of drafting a Green Paper and a communication from the Commission outlining concrete policies for the role of culture in the EU's external actions.
In particular, these directives propose to strengthen surveillance mechanisms in a stringent manner in order to prevent any more Greek-style financial crises within the Union.
In relation to my report, Baroness Ashton, I would particularly like you to take note of paragraph 6, which calls for the drafting of a White Paper with a strategic focus on the European Union's role in international organisations through to 2020.
In spite of the restrictions and bans which have been introduced, much illegal fishing goes on, or even fishing that can be considered pillaging.
In the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council entitled 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' (COM(2009) 433 final), it is acknowledged that 'GDP has also come to be regarded as a proxy indicator for overall societal development and progress in general' but 'does not measure environmental sustainability or social inclusion'. In a world in which people's quality of life is increasingly measured using other, non-economic factors, various international institutions, like the United Nations (UN), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), are currently studying the definition of new indicators, so as to measure and analyse economic and social progress.
In the case of Belarus, it is not possible to fulfil this aim in its entirety due to the measures adopted.
In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should be able to consider issues freely and make decisions independently. I would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of. If we conduct a national comparison, we will see that there are only a few Member States of the European Union who have already established a transparency register at this level.
In the last section, I then propose that we in Parliament create an autonomous impact assessment structure.
In the near future, there will be other power stations in other Member States which will need to be halted because they are reaching the end of their operational life.
In the same connection, it is natural that the reform and harmonisation of product labelling should be assessed overall, as has now been agreed.
In this case, it seems that things went wrong.
In this context, the Commission will examine measures to reduce excessive dependence on external ratings, improve transparency, promote competition, introduce the principle of liability and reduce the risk of potential conflicts of interest due to the issuer-pays payment model.
In this regard, it should be said that the European Arrest Warrant responds to a need, particularly in view of the fact that it is not only honest citizens who mostly take advantage of the freedom to move around the European Union, but also criminals, who do not by any means exercise their rights for tourism or business purposes, but for criminal activities, or to avoid being brought to justice in their own country or in the country in which they committed the crime.
In this respect, it will be essential to achieve the full engagement of public and local authorities. A fundamental objective of innovation is to maintain a high level of prosperity in Europe. I hope the joining of forces which has been proposed will contribute to support for the process of innovation and help bring about economic stabilisation.
In this way, we can also contribute - thanks to the technologies and the agricultural techniques that will be used by farmers - not only to ensuring economic competitiveness, but also to reducing the impact of agricultural activity on climate change.
In view of the fact that CO2 emissions know no borders, and that after production is transferred emissions will continue, which will unavoidably have a negative impact on the environment, the European Union economy will lose out, since it is exporting jobs.
In view of this, I voted in favour of this report, as it will allow the Member States, if they so wish, to also charge road users for some limited external costs, with the aim of introducing the 'polluter pays' principle to road transport.
Indeed, I want to ask Mr Piebalgs in his reply to explain what the EU is doing to combat continuing and deteriorating human rights violations, in particular, concerning human rights defenders such as Hawa Abdulla from the AU-UN peace-keeping mission, who has been subject to arbitrary detention and beaten.
Indeed, the conclusions of the scientific opinion given by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) at the end of 2007 are based on data concerning the slaughter of animals in abattoirs and which are not reliable with regard to seal hunting.
Information and communications technology (ICT) is important in all innovative activity. ICT skills depend on improvements in the quality of training, support for lifelong learning, and the opportunity for those already in employment to update their own knowledge and skills continuously.
Instead of lengthening the pain and piling even more burdens on the Greek economy, it would be far better to accept the inevitable and the judgment of the markets.
Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure: see Minutes
Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect nothing more of Russia's democratisation? I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections - there must be progress there.
It also criticises any attempt to cut the funding of the DCI and the European Development Fund, and stresses once again that not enough progress has been made with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and that there is a need to increase Official Development Assistance (ODA).
It believes this measure to be long overdue, and that budgetisation of the EDF should take place at the earliest possible date.
It discusses funding for Roma communities, a subject that my political party has always opposed, and the allocation of large amounts of funding for a new round of enlargement of the European Union in the direction of the Western Balkans, another point with which I do not agree.
It goes without saying that the constitution of every Member State should reflect and comply with the European values of freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, human dignity and respect of human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, without discrimination, as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty.
It has not been possible to achieve this ambitious goal. I hope that the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy will be met, in particular, the EU's commitment to invest 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in research and development by 2020.
It is a fact that, in Europe, we have too little funding for higher education.
It is a very positive development that the adoption of this directive will end the situation in Estonia in which vehicles from other countries do not pay the tax in Estonia, but our vehicles pay in other countries.
It is also essential in increasing competitiveness as the EU overcomes the economic crisis.
It is also vital for governments to be able to undertake stimulus spending, as the Labour government did in 2008/2009, to prevent this crisis from turning into a global depression.
It is both mandatory and normal practice in Germany for a legal entity to register its address in an online directory when it is founded.
It is crucial, in fact, to continue along this path in order to furnish the European Union with the tools to compete with and face its main trade partners, such as the United States, Canada, China and Japan, on the globalised market.
It is essential to give young Europeans the tools necessary for them to be able to compete in a globalised world and for them to be able to enter the labour market using their knowledge and skills.
It is good that the submitted directive emphasises better quality supervision and controls, but especially the greater transparency of these processes and public participation.
It is important that this agreement be adopted, as Croatia is one of the main transit routes through which illicit drugs are smuggled into the EU, so it is vital that this country be involved in the EMCDDA's work as soon as possible, particularly bearing in mind that Croatia's accession to the EU is envisaged for the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013.
It is impossible to accept that MEPs will not be subject to public scrutiny regarding the interests they defend in their role, or the pressure they are subject to or who is putting them under pressure. I therefore very much welcome the introduction of the common register of lobbyists and lobbying organisations.
It is more difficult but more beneficial for the people of Europe to make progress in this area.
It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic product (GDP) and that is just the start.
It is not surprising that the report should conclude that a single European solution is not possible.
It is only after this that we review the Schengen system and look at how it can be adjusted or improved, because we can see that there are indeed problems with it, but let us stick to this order of things.
It is quite simply necessary to have these bilateral agreements, and therefore I welcome them.
It is the case that, in waiting for the implementation of a genuine common diplomacy and a genuine European defence policy, European soft power and its cultural diplomacy are some of the few means of influence at our disposal.
It is therefore extremely important that the checking and assessment of the European reactors does not become a paper tiger, but that it really is a proper assessment.
It is these citizens and their well-being that should be the main focus of democratisation, political pluralism, and respect for human rights and for religious, cultural and ethnic diversity in both South and North Sudan.
It is unacceptable that, in the face of the extremely severe crisis affecting the most vulnerable economies in the EU, they are continuing to make unsupportable cofinancing demands for the use of Union funds, specifically the Structural Funds.
It is vital that the international community maintains its presence and a very high level of humanitarian involvement.
It is, however, not at all obvious that with an additional own resource that would reduce the dependence on GNI, we can expect a revolution in EU capacities to finance growth and structural change.
It must ensure the highest possible level of European added value, it must be sensibly managed and it must support public and private resources as far as possible.
It recognises the important role that regional and local governments play in shaping European legislation, and therefore clearly differentiates between lobbyists and local and regional government officials.
It should be a key element of public policy in such areas as the environment, water, energy, transport, telecommunications, health and education.
It should not be limited to the elimination of tariff or non-tariff barriers but should represent an opportunity to take a qualitative leap in the elimination of environmental and health policy differences, and I refer, in particular, to the farming sector, the protection of animal species at risk of extinction and particular economic extractive activities that have a significant environmental impact, such as asbestos mining and oil sands drilling, or that restrict access to medicines for the poorest countries.
It was also found that there was a lower take-up of fishing opportunities by long-liners, which led to a reduction in this segment in the current report.
It will be a comprehensive programme of technical assistance focused on growth and jobs, but with an emergency character because - I repeat - Greece is living in an emergency situation.
It would appear that this text also allows the right to abortion in Hungary to be restricted by stating, and I quote, 'that the life of the foetus will be protected from the time of conception'. The Hungarian Government has backed up its words by action in this area by launching an anti-abortion communication campaign which would still, apparently, appear to be using funds from the European PROGRESS programme (Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity).
Its accession to the World Trade Organisation will create numerous opportunities in economic relations between the European Union and Russia.
Just as we did with dairy products when a deep crisis broke out in that sector, we need now, too, to call that surplus into use.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we understand innovation simply in terms of new products, processes and services that result in an increase in economic activity, it is essential that we equip ourselves with the instruments to measure our innovation capacity precisely in economic terms and that we do so on the basis of parameters, such as private investment and R&D, employment or the number of innovative companies.
Last week in Ireland, forest fires - on a scale not seen for a long time - caused severe destruction on lands in Donegal, Sligo and other regions of the country.
Lastly, I should like to voice my support for two powerful ideas upheld by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats): the power conferred on the European Commission to adopt delegated acts should be reviewed every five years, and a verification clause should be introduced - the verification clause being the second powerful idea in this regulation.
Launched in Budapest on 29 April, Youth at Work will bring together small and medium-sized enterprises and young job seekers and will provide information and support to inspire young people to set up their own businesses.
Let me explain briefly: through the use of origin marking, buyers will be sure they are buying a textile product that is not harmful to their health nor that of their children because the labelling will comply with all the rules of this important regulation which, at the cost of significant sacrifices, European institutions have imposed on all industries in this sector.
Let us also follow up on this by truly taking the steps that the knowledge provided by this measure makes possible.
Let us not, therefore, ignore this reality that investment is urgently needed: all the more so if the shameful and obscurantist intervention plan drawn up by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission is implemented.
Like the rapporteur, I support the Commission's Action Plan for the development of EGNOS and Galileo, which is based on nine horizontal measures with an immediate transport application.
Madam President, Commissioner, I am delighted that, in advance of the next General Assembly of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), we can debate this welcome initiative of the ILO proposing to the Member States of this organisation a convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Presidency of Parliament for having allowed this debate to take place, as it was not on the agenda initially.
Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission is obviously taking notice of this subject. I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint.
Madam President, for South Sudan, the 9 July date goes before everything else; for North Sudan, although the comprehensive peace agreement may be coming to an end, its obligations do not.
Madam President, on 9 July, South Sudan will declare independence as an English-speaking new African state.
Madam President, the regulation on transitional arrangements for bilateral investment treaties is an important legislative initiative.
Make the system fairer and more transparent, and then we can talk about own resources.
Many points in the submitted reports go in the right direction, but at the same time they have a number of deficiencies.
Member States must also cooperate with partner countries to ensure the protection of vulnerable groups and to fight gender discrimination as well as discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, religion, age and disability. I hope that the Commission will come forward with some concrete proposals which will bring about improved labour and social standards, as well as proposals to promote corporate social responsibility in its external polices.
Minimum standards have therefore now been established, as domestic workers form the largest unregulated sector in the world.
More than a year ago already, the European Parliament clearly expressed its support for the idea of a democratic process which could lead to elections.
Moreover, it fails to mention the social reasons that lead to early school drop-out, to a lack of access to higher education opportunities and to youth unemployment, just so as to mask the responsibility of the neoliberal policies promoted by large companies and financial institutions.
Moreover, there is already an example of good practice: our presence in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). There is, therefore, an urgent need for the EU to be represented with a single voice in the various international bodies. I think that drawing up a White Paper on this subject, as is proposed in the report, could be a good 'beginning of the end' for this bizarre situation.
Mr Albertini, I am happy to stand anywhere as long as it is actually in the room - I suspect there may be a few people who would prefer it if I was not - and I am very happy to speak from the podium; it is the obvious place between the two. I do appreciate very much the work that you, Mr Albertini, and the other rapporteurs have done in producing what I think are really useful and helpful reports in terms of addressing the breadth of European action.
Mr Itälä rightly argues in recital 5 that we must take adequate measures to ensure for a responsible attitude towards our general expenditure allowance. I hope that recital will stay, because it is good for credibility and transparency.
Mr President, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the process we are dealing with today - that is, the discharge for the expenditure of the European Commission - is an essential process.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has set out its priorities in the light of an alarming fact: the economic, financial and social crisis is continuing to wreak havoc, with 23 million people currently unemployed, including 5.2 million young people.
Mr President, I had understood that a question was being asked, but one was not put to me. What I would like to say is that I still feel it is wrong that we can put in the same boat, on an equal footing, democracies such as the United States or EU Member States, and countries and societies where power is exercised in an authoritarian and totalitarian manner, with ordinary citizens suffering excessive abuses.
Mr President, I wish to support this resolution on human rights violations and war crimes committed in Sri Lanka.
Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt asked the Commission to rewrite the communication but I wonder if, before it is rewritten, we could get a clear answer today as to whether or not you are aiming to improve the current existing system, to temporarily close borders, or to add something to the existing system.
Mr President, developments in Azerbaijan regarding democracy and human rights continue to be a matter of serious concern to all of us. Over the last few years, we have noted a worrying trend of increasing restrictions in this domain.
Mr President, in recent years, academic and political focus on culture and education has increased dramatically, with analysis consistently highlighting these areas to be crucial not only in encouraging economic growth and social cohesion, but also in facilitating mobility for young people across Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eurovignette and the results of the negotiations represent an example of how the Council is currently attempting to place limitations on and water down all Parliament's proposals, particularly in the field of transport policy.
Mr President, over the past three months, my office has sent emails, made phone calls and drafted lists to raise awareness of this declaration on missing persons in Cyprus.
Mr President, the explosion at Chernobyl was a disaster, but let us keep it in perspective: 64 people were killed by Chernobyl radiation over 23 years, and it caused an unknown proportion of 6000 cases of thyroid cancer.
Mr President, these are just a few of the topics on which work has already started.
Mr President, when the European system of protected designations of origin (PDOs), protected geographical indications (PGIs) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSGs) was set up, equivalent systems already existed in some Member States.
Mr Zver's report draws attention to numerous barriers that act as disincentives to mobility in Europe, and I would like to highlight some of them.
Mutual acceptance of certification findings constitutes a massive benefit for the EU, given that it will establish mutual acceptance of certification findings in all areas of airworthiness for all Member States.
My home city of Gdańsk is in a small group leading the Polish contest, which will be decided this month. I am a keen supporter of this candidacy whose motto is 'Cultural freedom - culture of freedom'. Gdańsk is, historically, a Hanseatic port and the birthplace of the Solidarity movement, which is synonymous with freedom.
My second point is that the report says that the working languages of the EU are French, English and German.
Negative ratings in the face of financial difficulties send a country into a kind of debt spiral, because a falling rating increases the cost of borrowing even more and makes the country's financial situation even worse.
Nevertheless, the Commission considers that the current ILO initiative is a good opportunity to reflect on the situation of domestic servants in Europe.
Nineteen weeks later, the Irish banks collapsed and taxpayers across Europe were forced into a bail-out, and just last week we learnt that EUR 12 billion of the proposed Portuguese bail-out is for their banks.
Nonetheless, much more can be done to help European SMEs, specifically: the swift implementation by the Member States of the Late Payments Directive; better Commission mechanisms for encouraging the Member States to apply the principles of the SBA; adoption by the Member States, without delay, of the last remaining proposal on the European Private Company Statute; the regular application by the Commission and the Member States of the SME test as part of impact assessments; the urgently needed reduction of the bureaucratic and administrative burden on SMEs; and putting 'Erasmus for young entrepreneurs' on a permanent footing, with a sufficient budget.
Not only does the regional government find itself unable to pay the wages of 76 000 employees, but it still owes roughly EUR 2 billion to its various suppliers.
Now the Member States have two years to implement the new directive. I would like to call for this timeframe to be shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would not present a significant problem.
Nuclear accidents occur without warning and unexpectedly.
Of course, all such trials by the US authorities - which, after all, is a country that is a democracy and shares our common values - must nevertheless be conducted fairly with all legal safeguards of due process, and ideally by civilian courts.
Of course, we must not forget and we cannot ignore various important issues, which continue to hinder the development of valuable relations between the EU and Russia, and especially, moreover, the fact that nearly three years after the war in Georgia, Russia continues to occupy a large part of the sovereign territory of Georgia, continues to ignore the agreement concluded in 2008, and fails to ensure proper access to these territories by the European Union Observer Mission.
On 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council, meeting in Lisbon, set the European Union an objective: to become, by 2010, the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world.
On that occasion, the Council endorsed the Presidency's conclusions on the progress made and the need to continue to work in close cooperation with all Member States towards a solution acceptable to all parties involved.
On the issue of compensation, this will be discussed this afternoon in the AGRI Council, and I am sure that my colleague, Commissioner Cioloş, is doing his utmost to identify and develop ways and means of compensating our farmers who have been suffering as a result of this problem.
On the other hand, a prior full assessment of the impact of the measures proposed has not been conducted by the Commission. I think that it would have had a major impact, in particular, on Pakistan's population and this country's budget resources.
On the other hand, we know that there are exceptions where export is allowed.
Once again, I voted in favour of this report which points out that real savings could be made if Parliament only had one workplace, in the same city as the European Union's other institutions (in other words Brussels). The report of the Secretary-General on Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for 2011 itself draws attention to the huge annual costs arising from the geographical split of Parliament, estimated at some EUR 160 000 000, which accounts for 9% of Parliament's total budget.
One important aspect is the digitisation of cultural productions, along with the need to create a proper single market for online content and services which will generate additional jobs.
One of the most important fields is strengthening our role and coordination in the United Nations system.
One very important point is that the partnership principle must be taken to a new and better level.
Opening the borders has been one of the European Union's greatest achievements. I am therefore delighted that Parliament has voted in favour of these two new States joining the Schengen area.
Our amendments in the Committee on International Trade have been successful, firstly, in ensuring that the Commission's powers are fully respected and, secondly, in stating that legal certainty should be guaranteed.
Our objective is to be in a position to meet the challenges which, let us not forget, threaten the very existence of mankind on this planet.
Overall, I believe that the legislative package which has been presented is an appropriate response to the global crisis and the EU's current economic situation, building on the relevant legislation and complying with the Europe 2020 strategy and other strategic EU documents, and therefore I recommend adopting it in the amended version.
Parliament has been asked to waive the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Severin, as a result of criminal proceedings in which he is accused of defamation under the Criminal Code of Romania.
Parliament specifically welcomes the Agency as a reliable provider of independent and assured environmental information for all Union institutions, the Member States and policy-making bodies.
Particular focus should be directed towards the formulation of regulation which ensures greater spectrum efficiency, better frequency planning and safeguards against anti-competitive behaviour and the taking of anti-social measures with regards to the usage of the spectrum.
Perhaps it would still be possible to change this during the process of reaching a parliamentary decision by the end of June.
Point four: Russia is the neighbour of our neighbours, and I think Nizhny Novgorod would be an excellent opportunity to refer to the recently adopted ENP review document and, with reference to this document, to make sure that we are transparent in our policy vis-à-vis the neighbours we share with Russia.
President I fear that these concerns have been exacerbated for political ends by certain factions here and elsewhere in Europe and I wish to make a clear stance regarding our future energy mix that is free from fear and panic and approaches the subject of nuclear energy based on science and evidence. I would like to thank the rapporteur and my friend and colleague Ms Edit Herczog for all their efforts on this.
Promoting labour standards through the EU's negotiations with third party countries benefits both the Member States and the third party countries.
Quite apart from the fact that this puts the imported labour force in a worse position than that of the host country, it also contributes to social dumping.
Recycling, air emissions, climate change, sustainable consumption and production must be monitored continuously in order to achieve progress in these areas across the whole of Europe. A system for preparing environmental economic accounts is one of the measures that would aid the collection and compilation of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes applicable to various economic sectors and macro-economic material flow accounting.
Registered entities will also have to declare their sources of income and interests, as well as legislative proposals submitted.
Representatives of the European Union will be able to speak at the General Assembly and submit amendments agreed by the Member States of the EU. This is a joint achievement of the Member States, the Commission and Council, but also of the European Parliament.
Rigour in terms of information means there is a need for equal rigour in accounting. I hope the monitoring centre will not desist from truly and accurately carrying out the mission entrusted to it, and that it will do so whilst managing its budget the best it can. I also hope that any information it gathers will help the Member States to follow closely the causes and consequences of this scourge, and to point to paths and solutions enabling affected Europeans to free themselves from the addiction destroying them and their families.
Sarajevo occupies a very important place in Europeans' historical consciousness. I support awarding the title of European Capital of Culture exceptionally to the city in 2014.
Secondly, I would like to highlight the need for greater emphasis to be placed on thematic areas crucial for the future of Europe, such as energy security, the environment and health care.
Secondly, regarding Cathy Ashton, she is not only Vice-President of the Commission, but also High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
Secondly, we have had very good cooperation between the Commission, the ECB and the IMF, which was not self-evident when we started about a year and a half ago in terms of fire-fighting the financial turmoil.
Several of the comments on increasing transparency are along the right lines. I also consider it reasonable for Parliament to award prizes, especially for the purpose of supporting European cinema.
Similarly, disability should not be an obstacle either, and that is why additional funding should be set aside for young people with disabilities.
Since the 'Rose Revolution', the Georgian Government has consistently implemented democratic reforms, modernising its country and carrying out difficult, unpopular economic and social reforms that are essential in the long term.
Since we cannot just wish it out of existence, we need to deal with nuclear waste in the most responsible way possible.
So climate change and women is very much on the agenda.
So we also need to do something in the ETS system to make sure we have the right price and really have the incentives to move to green technologies.
So, what I am asking of Ms Malmström and Mr Barroso is a rewriting of the communication and specifically of the sentence which states that a new mechanism shall be introduced for the reintroduction of border checks.
Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance, and I call on my fellow Members, and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular, to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all.
South Sudan will be one of the poorest countries on earth, and if we want the Millennium Development Goals to also take effect here, it is urgently necessary that the funding made available by the Council - EUR 200 million - should actually be spent on food security, education and health in this part of the world.
Statistics show that around one in three young Europeans has tried an illicit drug and at least one of our citizens dies every hour from a drug overdose.
Such a requirement does not conform with the principles of positive trade relations.
Sure, Member States often lack the political will to act in a unified and decisive way, and they do not want to see you strong, but believe me, Baroness Ashton, they will not support you and will not save your life as High Representative.
Taking this lack into account, it's imperative to improve the governance system for the EU2020 Strategy, with greater integration of stakeholders at all stages.
Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has gained additional powers and corresponding responsibilities, and must now monitor the conduct of negotiations and the conclusion of air agreements more closely.
That is a slippery slope that could result in serious imbalances and, hence, unfair treatment of the poorest countries.
That is simply unsellable to taxpayers around Europe and it does not enhance the credibility of the EU institutions.
That is what makes European territorial cooperation the embodiment of European integration and an extraordinary source of competitiveness.
That is why creating an optional instrument that will operate as a standard for SMEs alongside national rules, by broadening the parties' options, is the right strategy.
That is why this evening, at the end of this debate, the European Commission is renewing its desire to press ahead with origin labelling.
That means that the Member States would have to give up further large portions of sovereignty over foreign policy to EU bodies, which would be charged with reaching a common position to be presented in the international community and in all multilateral forums. I cannot agree with this prospect: the Member States would no longer be able to establish their own foreign policies on the basis of what they deem to be national priorities.
That will benefit everyone in rural areas.
The 1941 deportations delivered a devastating blow to democratic civil society.
The Azerbaijani Government is losing its credibility by breaching conventions it has itself signed up to, such as the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Commission also welcomes the fact that the report supports some of its suggestions addressed to the European Parliament through the Smart Regulation Communication, but we also know about the few highly problematic proposals.
The Commission has not identified any infringements to date.
The Commission is recommending the adoption of many documents relating to migration in May and June. I would like to express the hope that, in formulating these documents, the Commission will maintain a measure of detachment and a cool head.
The Commission representatives on the governing boards of agencies take the need for quantitative and qualitative performance criteria very seriously and make every effort to ensure that they are applied.
The Commission will present its proposals for the next multiannual financial framework at the end of June.
The Commissioner told Parliament's committee one month ago, when Mr Cadec put this question to her, that she was not mindful to support subsidies to compensate for the extra cost of fuel.
The Council and Commission have noted that Japan's capacity to remove regulatory barriers to trade is a precondition for launching negotiations on the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement (FTA), thus fostering closer economic integration between the two strategic trading partners.
The Court of Auditors Annual Report for 2009 found the highest error rate to be in payments under the EU's cohesion policy.
The EIB intended to supplement the loans for medium-sized businesses with EUR 1 billion a year. I would like to ask the Commission at what stage of implementation this programme is at, whether it intends to top up the funding, and whether these funds are distributed equally to all Member States.
The EU decided to set up its own global navigation satellite system for two key reasons: firstly, Europe's independence from other global navigation systems and autonomy, and secondly, to gain a share in this fast growing worldwide high-tech market, which today, to a large extent, is dominated by the US. Indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year (including the downstream and upstream market and public benefits). GNSS is seen as a disruptive technology, with high potential to create innovations, build up a high-tech knowledge base and increase productivity in many sectors.
The EU is, in fact, the only trading block that does not provide direct funding to its GNSS programme.
The EU's EGNOS and Galileo projects can contribute to competitiveness in every area of this sector of services, because they are markedly better and more accurate than the GPS system while also being compatible with it. Unfortunately, the countries in the east and south of the Union are still not covered by the EGNOS system.
The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate, training, and eradicating poverty). What is needed, as far as vocational education and training are concerned, is to take practical steps at EU level and in Member States for putting the strategy into practice.
The European Council has also discussed the situation in our neighbourhood, in particular the implementation of the Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean.
The European Parliament approved the provisions set out in this Green Paper, but the EU's strategy on forests should be strengthened, the objective being to improve the management and conservation of forests.
The European Social Fund should become a political priority in order to achieve social and employment goals.
The European Union must enable the creation of new financing instruments promoting research spending and private investments.
The European Union's small and medium-sized companies should also receive particular attention and, as such, it will be appropriate to insist on the need to clarify the budgetary implications of the Europe 2020 strategy's flagship initiatives.
The Foundation must therefore take steps to improve its evaluation and review procedure to avoid the repetition of such errors in the future.
The Hungarian Presidency has some important success stories under its belt: the Danube strategy and the adoption of the Roma strategy.
The MEDIA programme is celebrating 20 years at the Cannes Festival this year and is supporting 20 of the competing films as well as festivals, performing arts and large exhibitions, which are taking place throughout the year and across Europe.
The Northern army has occupied Abyei and 15 000 people have taken flight. I believe that we, the European Union, must help in a very tangible way as we did before and that this must take the form of getting food and humanitarian aid for the refugees moving as soon as possible and preparing the emergency humanitarian aid for the refugees.
The Russia of today should not see this as a political attack, but as an offer of support in engaging with its own history, which, just like the history of the other countries in Europe, is characterised by positive as well as negative times.
The Spanish State is a paradigmatic example of that: it is attempting to meet requirements by passing its deficit on to the autonomous governments and local councils.
The UK Government is looking into HGV charges to bring us in line with Europe by 2015.
The Waste Shipments Regulation prohibits exports of hazardous waste to developing countries, as well as exports outside the Union and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries of waste intended for disposal.
The adoption of a Parliament resolution on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices is an opportunity for me to remind you how urgent it is for us to come to the aid of fishermen.
The agreement will be applied by parties, in their capacities as port states, for vessels not entitled to fly their flags, while seeking entry to ports or while they are in port.
The aim of their work is not to produce added value, but to provide care or services similar to the tasks which women usually carry out free of charge in their own homes.
The answer to the pressure of migration is not the reintroduction of internal border control, but the acceleration of the ongoing negotiations for the purpose of adopting the refugee package, the common European migration policy and the Schengen evaluation system as soon as possible.
The average additional cost to hauliers should not exceed 4 euro cents per vehicle per kilometre, and the least polluting vehicles, driving during off-peak times, would be exempt.
The calls for appropriate verification as regards financing the activities of those who register: here I can assure you that the Commission is already performing random checks on all the registrants that are already in the register and I am sure that these activities will even increase once we manage the register jointly.
The codification of the existing legislative texts is the result of approximating the legislation of the Member States to the establishment of technical rules on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, which promote environmental sustainability at European level.
The concerns about the excessive use of detention and custody measures and of travel restrictions also give the impression of an arbitrary approach to justice.
The coordination of 27 different foreign and security policies is not the easiest of tasks, and you cannot blame the captain alone for the shipwreck.
The cultural and creative industries sector is made up of enterprises with great economic potential because they generate employment, growth and wealth, and are responsible for the social and cultural integration of citizens.
The current political situation in North Africa and the Middle East has exacerbated the problem.
The decision on admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area now remains a purely political one.
The development of these systems will make an essential contribution to the development of European aviation transport and to a more economical and efficient system of rail and road transport. A problem for the development of these applications and for completing the systems on time may be a lack of investment.
The discussions were lengthy, but the good news is that we did not permit the attempts to make ad hoc changes to the Schengen membership criteria.
The economic crisis should not be a reason for education spending cuts, because combating the impacts of the crisis requires that young people receive higher levels of education.
The enhancement of economic governance must be based on a robust framework for preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances, minimum requirements for national budgetary frameworks, enhanced financial market regulation and supervision, and a credible, permanent crisis resolution mechanism. I think that coherence is required among policies aimed at growth and creating sustainable jobs, with a particular focus on the development and strengthening of the internal market, fostering international trade and competitiveness and providing an effective framework for preventing and correcting excessive budgetary positions.
The exemptions for EURO V and EURO VI are also positive, as well as the fact that the Member States have again committed to regulating the interoperability of toll systems, as it is a thorn in our sides that that is still not the case.
The fact is that there have been over 2 000 infections and more than 20 people have died.
The failure today inside and outside the EU to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to both European enterprises and EU and non-EU workers and citizens.
The financing instrument for development cooperation is aimed at helping poorer partner countries in the field of trade and regional integration, the natural environment and the management of natural resources, infrastructure, water and energy, rural development, agriculture and food security, human development and social cohesion.
The first thing I want to do is to welcome the fact that it is going to be a Pillar Two structure, because I think that is what we are all agreed on.
The fuel price is high, yet the price of fish is low, at a record low, in fact.
The goals of introducing complete broadband coverage of the EU by 2013 and universal high-speed Internet access by 2020 are praiseworthy, but perhaps not entirely realistic.
The identification system, described as an 'alert mechanism', uses both a scoreboard of quantitative indicators and qualitative assessments. I believe that this scoreboard is important in terms of giving us a general and complete overview, and I therefore believe it should be a flexible and adaptable instrument so that it can be modified and adapted to varying requirements and situations, clearly guaranteeing a framework of legal certainty. I hope that Parliament will reach a final agreement and approve the entire governance package as quickly as possible, in order to send a strong and unified message to the public and the markets and to stop speculation.
The incumbent Hungarian Government failed the stress test you envision, Commissioner, because it has repeatedly impeded the construction of the NATO radar facility, which would have provided greater protection for the Paks nuclear power plant against aircraft attacks than the protection we have today, for the past seven years.
The intermediate category contradicts the principle of converging European regions whose development is below the average European Union level.
The joint long, analytical and preparatory work has resulted, in my opinion, in increasing transparency and tighter management discipline.
The latter represents a key piece of information for the consumer before a product is purchased.
The main aim of the INDECT project (Intelligent information system supporting observation, searching and detection for security of citizens in urban environment), which is implemented by the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, is the development of research into information technologies which increase the safety of citizens of urban areas.
The management, staff and governance structure of the new ECRF would be fully independent and autonomous. I welcome the proposal that CRAs' exposure to civil liability in the event of gross negligence or misconduct be defined on a consistent basis across the EU. Furthermore, there is a need to increase supervisors' responsibilities, capacity, powers and resources for monitoring, assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models, for imposing prudential measures and conducting investigations and inspections.
The ministers of the Weimar initiative have raised this in a letter to you, Mrs Ashton.
The motion for a resolution shows clearly that there are still serious shortcomings over fulfilment of the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
The negotiation and signing of fisheries partnership agreements is in line with the EU's general objective of maintaining and preserving the activities of its fishing fleet, particularly the long-distance fleet, so the conclusion of this document is crucial to pursuing the foreign policy objectives of the common fisheries policy.
The new instrument must primarily fund measures which fulfil the criteria for ODA (Official Development Assistance) as defined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee.
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on Guantánamo: imminent death penalty decision.
The nuclear stress tests should not only help the Commission revise the safety directive, but should also be included in the Commission report on the external dimension of energy policy which will soon be published.
The only long-term solution to this problem is for the Greeks to reintroduce the drachma, which could be devalued on its own.
The outcomes show that this fund has been the most effective tool to date for accomplishing the goals enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Lisbon.
The petitioners assert that the local threshold for carrying out an environmental impact assessment (EIA), which was 20 hectares at the time, was not adhered to; that instead, the project was artificially subdivided into smaller parts and that in reality, the 20 hectare threshold was exceeded.
The pre-school period being the most important for the child's emotional and social development, those working with these children should have the required qualifications.
The problem could only be overcome thanks to the diligence of the ambassadors of Romania and Bulgaria, who requested the declassification of the reports and their submission to Parliament, so enabling Members of this House to have access to the content of the evaluations, recommendations and final conclusions.
The project encourages exchanges of best practice, in particular, involving precarious workers' collective representation. A second call for proposals, to be issued this year, will relate more specifically to action to improve the rights of the poorest workers, including domestic workers.
The proposal states that the further enlargement of the United Nations Security Council in order to include the EU is a key factor for effectively pursuing the objectives mentioned above.
The protocol provides for a Union contribution to the Seychelles of EUR 16.8 million over three years, of which EUR 2.22 million per year will go towards support for the Seychelles' fisheries policy.
The question is what role will the European Commission play in future when implementing all the points in the 2020 programme we have presented today. I would like to see the Commission choose a stronger role for itself, rather than delegating all the tasks to others.
The rapporteur rightly warns of the sensitivity of the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece region in terms of illegal immigration. I agree with him when he points to the need for Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area, and an approach to combating a potential sharp increase in migration pressure common to Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria.
The reason that Greeks are on the streets protesting is that they understand perfectly well what the consequence of this EU/IMF takeover will be. The money is not going to ordinary Greek people, it is going to those financial institutions which hold Greek government debt.
The regions will then set and agree very realistic but also ambitious and quantifiable targets together with us in the Commission in a partnership and investment agreement so that, at the end of the period, we will be clearly able to see whether or not the objectives agreed between us have been achieved or perhaps even exceeded.
The report also mentions that the common agricultural policy should be fairer and more equitable, with a distribution of financial resources between countries that is more balanced, and a system of direct support for farmers that is fairer and based on environmental and social criteria.
The report calls on Member States to exchange good practices regarding their vocational education system and training systems combined with work experience, which should be extended in many Member States, particularly in France.
The report is balanced because it focuses on animal welfare, the problems of antibiotic resistance and cost-effectiveness as far as the farms are concerned.
The report seeks to correct the vulnerabilities of national economies by increasing - excessively in my view - the authority of the EU over the Member States themselves, thus sacrificing their freedom and powers in relation to finance. I therefore cannot vote in favour of this report.
The reports on the CFSP of the EU and its role on the international stage, which was supported by the main coalition of the political representatives of capital in the European Parliament, namely the conservatives, social democrats and liberals, illustrate its acutely reactionary character and anti-grassroots role.
The response to these challenges will have to be sought in the Europe 2020 strategy, which should be the policy reference of the next MFF.
The right systematically opposed the amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in order to rule out any liberalisation of public services, strongly condemn child labour, request legally binding clauses on corporate social responsibility and demand respect for the principle of equal pay for equal work with regard to Indians who will come and work in Europe in the future.
The sarcophagus is not yet safe, which is why new financial resources are required to put this in order. I have not yet heard any plans for what to do with the nuclear waste lying about the site; the disposal of this material is not yet assured.
The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union. I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light.
The sole response has been that only Romanian legislation and the country's constitution are applicable.
The structural funds were set up mainly to even out differences between individual regions, and they should therefore be directed particularly towards the most backward parts of the EU, in other words towards convergence Objective 1. The richer regions will benefit from this through increased market opportunities for their products and services.
The talk in our media is about rescuing Greece, giving assistance to Portugal, and helping Ireland, but that is not how the peoples in the recipient countries see it.
The third point is that Europe cannot be founded on values of human rights and social rights and develop the relevant EU acquis without also developing the protection of wages, the protection of working hours, the protection of health, knowledge of the demands of domestic work, and without providing domestic workers with a certain number of guarantees. I wish to sound a word of warning, which is that this should not lead to the integration of workers that are in a totally illegal situation.
The trend towards suburbanisation, the concentration of deprivation and unemployment in urban neighbourhoods, increased congestion and other problems of similar complexity require solutions in the fields of transport and housing, as well as in training and employment schemes which must be tailored to local needs.
The use of any products of animal origin must be clearly shown on the label of the textile product.
The women in particular are looking for the stronger voice that they believe they have been promised in the future of Egypt. I met one woman who will be a presidential candidate and who is determined to show that women have that role to play in Egypt. I have talked with many government ministers, and let me give you the example of the Planning Minister, Fayza Aboulnaga.
Then we will have an investment policy for the future.
There are increasingly large economic divergences and social inequalities caused by the EU's neoliberal guidelines and policies, and by the increasingly unfair sharing and distribution of national income, both at EU level and at national level.
There are three points that I want to make.
There have been referenda in Member States and they have been ignored.
There is a need to enhance, stimulate and secure the financing of research and development in the European Union via a significant increase in relevant expenditure from 2013 onwards, because such an increase in funding, ideally by increasing the budget, must foster sustainable growth and competition via excellence.
There is an inherent conflict of interest if market participants devise internal credit risk assessments for their own regulatory capital requirements. I see the need to increase supervisors' responsibilities, capacity, powers and resources for monitoring, assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models and for imposing prudential measures. I believe that credit ratings must serve the purpose of increasing information to the market in a manner that provides investors with a consistent assessment of credit risk across sectors and countries, and consider it important to enable users to better scrutinise CRAs.
There is no need to stress the importance of this initiative.
There is talk about smart urban development and about the need for cities to improve and modernise their infrastructure and the services they offer.
There was a conference beforehand specifically called e-G8, attended by some of the big players in the Internet business and the authorities.
Therefore I would both ask and call upon the European Commission to conduct long-term and comprehensive research into the health-related consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
Therefore, I personally support Mr Falbr and his report. I am certain that it will also lead to improvements in these rules in Europe as well.
Therefore, before a decision is made on a further financial commitment from the EU budget in the next Multiannual Financial Framework, a clear assessment of all the possible technical options and related costs and benefits needs to be presented by the Commission.
Therefore, some aspects of the resolution deserve our support, specifically the criticism of the lack 'of transparency with regard to the composition and work of the Commission's internal advisory committee on public procurement (ACPP) and the role and competences of the Advisory Committee on the Opening-Up of Public Procurement (CCO)'. We also agree with the call for 'the Commission to take steps to ensure that the composition of both this committee and the planned new advisory committee on public/private partnerships is balanced, including trade unionists and representatives of the business community, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and that they work in a transparent manner'.
Therefore, this debate is a golden opportunity to give an account of what it has achieved on a number of dossiers, in close cooperation with this House.
These Eurobonds can be issued by the EFSF, by the ESM or by a new European agency in the future.
These are the principles behind our SME policy as presented in the review of the Small Business Act for Europe. I will outline five avenues of work in the frame of your five questions in the oral question in my response on behalf of the Commission.
These demands include stronger oversight of risks that a firm takes on, high standards of independence and diversity for members of firms' boards, including better gender balance and, crucially, transparency around pay, so shareholders and the public can hold banks to account.
These instruments provide for minimum standards which should underpin the adoption of measures by States in order to monitor, control and inspect foreign-flagged fishing vessels wishing to use their harbours.
These proposals are a good starting point, but I need a few more things on top of that.
These two anniversaries remind us how much has changed in Europe and how we Europeans were able to push through changes in Central and Eastern Europe with minimal losses, which culminated in the reunification of Eastern and Western Europe.
They are in oil, they are in the North of Sudan, but it is definitely a great help when the broader international community tries to find a solution to the issues.
They do not need to be added to this Register: but, if they have separate offices exclusively tasked with maintaining contact with European institutions, they must be included in their Register, though subject to a different legal regime to stakeholders.
They must be given greater encouragement by making the rules for accessing funds more flexible and by promoting them.
They were given the best possible treatment and the best possible care at a time when the Republic of Cuba was in a very difficult economic situation.
Thirdly, confirming 2013 as the date to free the 800 MHz digital dividend band, while recognising the need for derogations until 2015.
This Agreement will enable duplication of procedures to be kept to a minimum and mutual certification to be accepted: consequently, the financial savings and simplification of bureaucratic procedures will be of significance and have very positive repercussions for our businesses.
This agreement is of mutual benefit to the EU and Seychelles: on the one hand, is makes a substantial contribution to the stabilisation of the European canned tuna market through the granting of fishing licences for tuna, and thus promotes the creation of 760 jobs in Europe; and on the other hand, thanks to the implementation of the financial contribution's sectoral support, Seychelles is increasing its stock management and fisheries monitoring capacity.
This balancing of payments will not just be fairer, but will also better mobilise the various structures involved in agricultural production in order to respond to the new objectives that we are setting ourselves, because the historical examples of payments based on allocations received beforehand are no longer justified in the current context, in which we are now setting very clear objectives for the future common agricultural policy.
This connection will allow all Union countries to have access to online data about stowaways attempting to reach Europe and ensure more effective control at the European Union's external borders.
This directive is designed to ensure that Member States establish a national regulatory and organisational framework and draw up appropriate national programmes for spent fuel and radioactive waste management, regardless of the perspectives of nuclear power and non-power applications.
This extension is aimed at addressing the widespread economic crisis, given that terminating trade preferences would compromise these countries' economic recovery, and would have consequences for the whole stabilisation and transition process of the Western Balkans.
This grants the Executive Director of the European Network and Information Security Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.
This includes the harmonisation of size labelling, social economic labelling and, most worryingly, a radio frequency identification tag which would increase costs for business and prices for the consumer.
This is a forward-looking draft report, and while it is not the finished article, it is undoubtedly a way of safeguarding the legitimacy of the activities and decisions of the European institutions.
This is a time to try to understand each other's problems but also respect each other's differences.
This is an initiative of the Committee on International Trade, of which I am chair, and it is as chair that I am asking this question, in relation to which the political groups have reached agreement by consensus. I am pleased to be asking this question, which has had the approval of the political group coordinators on my committee and which seeks a response from the European Commission on a range of concerns regarding the state of play of the EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations, which have been ongoing since 2007.
This is due to a number of fundamental reasons: it is our contention that at a time of ongoing fiscal consolidation across Member States, it is totally unacceptable that the EU's large Cohesion budget should remain untouched by these efforts.
This is not demagogy but simple ...
This is precisely what countries such as Bulgaria and Romania have done, and it is precisely why we have helped Greece, by means of a Frontex mission there on the Turkish-Greek border.
This is the framework, of course, that was already outlined during the referendum process It is important that this continues, so as to ensure that the political will of both states and of the international community is put into practice in the form of genuine development projects for citizens of both countries.
This is understandable, because, alongside tax policy and domestic policy, an independent foreign policy is one of the key features, you might almost say an identifying feature, of national sovereignty.
This is why I voted for this report. I welcome the fact that Mr Coelho has mentioned the significance of the emigration pressure from Turkey on Bulgaria and Greece.
This is why we call on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary measures by 2015 to ensure that at least 50% of public procurement transactions are carried out electronically, in keeping with the commitment made by Member State governments in Manchester in 2005.
This leads me to my last point. I think it is regrettable that few of our innovative SMEs grow into larger companies and that there are fewer young, R&D-intensive, innovative firms in the EU than in the USA.
This means, first of all, conditionality: readiness not only to suggest and implore, but also to cause pain, i.e. to apply real sanctions to regimes which do not respect even the lives of their subjects. I agree that sanctions against Syria have to include hundreds of people, not just a dozen.
This new framework aims to promote competition and strengthen the integration of EU policies in order to consolidate the Europe 2020 strategy, in favour of big companies and financial institutions, and of the concentration and centralisation of capital.
This point is extremely important for the Azores in view of the fact that the sector plays a strategic role and quotas have been very important to milk producers until now. I must emphasise this, because alternatives to the milk quota scheme have not yet been put forward.
This proposal relates to amendments to the Community Customs Code and its implementing rules, concerning customs security measures for goods that are exported to or imported from non-EU countries.
This report address some of these issues, but it then limits itself to seeking to levy a new tax on heavy goods vehicles, to be added to the existing ones, some of which have been increased recently in Portugal, such as the 'shadow tolls'. The effectiveness of these is doubtful in terms of the effective pursuit of the stated objectives, while they represent an additional burden and may result in many companies going out of business given the current economic and social crisis.
This report considers whether the review of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) may offer an opportunity to consolidate the golden triangle of knowledge, education and research that is the key to Europeans' destiny. I welcome the level of participation and excellence in project selection but regret, however, that the success rate under this programme generally remains quite low and is a disincentive, particularly for SMEs. I support, within the framework of the 'People' chapter, the Marie Curie Actions, which are of great value to researchers in their career and acknowledge that 'Joint Technological Initiatives' (JTIs) assist the competitiveness of European industry.
This report is entirely consistent with policies of increased liberalisation, especially in the public service sector, and with standards which have deleterious effects not only on the supply of medicinal products, but also on the development of research.
This report provides for a framework to be established in order that Parliament can undertake its obligations under the Lisbon Treaty in regard to international air agreements.
This report, drafted by Mr Casini, concerns the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register. I would like to highlight that Parliament was the first institution to analyse the phenomenon of pressure groups, having launched the register for lobbyists in 1996.
This resolution covers a range of important themes. I particularly support the reservations expressed by the European Parliament in relation to the possible negative impact on European agriculture.
This situation is unfortunate, since we had made a lot of progress over recent months on the issues in the novel foods proposals.
This transparency register may be just a small victory, however it can be seen as a move in the same direction as Washington D.C., where the Lobbying Act on Disclosure has existed for some time.
This welcomes the fact that the Court of Auditors has managed to produce, every year, more and better special reports; regrets the fact that, unfortunately, they do not always get the political attention they deserve because of the rules applicable in Parliament; points out that those special reports are of great importance when reflecting on and changing and/or adapting programmes and projects, because they can result in a more efficient use of human and budgetary resources; and appreciates the positive attitude of the Commission to those processes and its willingness to take prompt action to remedy most of the shortcomings noted by the Court of Auditors in those reports.
This will help to alter the current absurd and unfair situation, where the amount of support can differ by up to a factor of as much as six, thereby putting farmers from several Member States in unequal circumstances and distorting competition between European farmers. I should like to emphasise that the transition period must be as short as possible, and I consider that for those Member States whose farmers receive the smallest direct payments, the equalisation process must begin as early as 2014. A transition period that lasted up to as late as 2020 would mean that a whole generation of farmers would continue to be forced to work in circumstances of unfair competition.
This would include improving investment conditions and development of the internal market, while also taking into account the specific priorities and needs of the Member States.
Those who do more, those who show that they deserve more, will receive more.
Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centre's budget for the financial year 2009.
Thus, the Digital Agenda, the digital economy and this, the first policy programme for five years, which have just been adopted, are vital for the development of the Internal Market.
To address this issue, since 1994, there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codified acts. I am pleased, therefore, that we can finally adopt a directive codifying Council Directive 80/720/EEC of 24 June 1980, and which approximates the legislation of the Member States on the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors.
To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that before Europe declares itself willing to open negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, it resolutely defines the Community interest that it intends to protect and specifies the areas in which it will request reciprocity from Japan.
To put it plainly, either the Stability and Growth Pact has this strange technical element that I have just mentioned, and then the Stability and Growth Pact will have teeth, or else it does not.
To this end, broadband coverage for the whole EU, including the outermost regions, will make a clear contribution to establishing the EU as an integrated area for information sharing, furthering its claim to be a cutting-edge digital economy. I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Today's debate must also send a signal to the Commission that we must continue these popularly well-received programmes and opportunities in the next generation of education and youth programmes, too, and that they must be well funded in keeping with their significance.
Today, it is our common duty to cherish the memory of the hundreds of thousands of victims of the Soviet terror in the Baltic States, and to condemn in the strongest terms the totalitarian system and the crimes against humanity committed by its leaders.
Too often, we have heard that spectrum planning and management is a technical issue that is the exclusive competence of the Member States.
Turkey is a privileged partner of the EU and, on the outside, declares a definite interest in becoming a full member of our European group. I therefore firmly believe that you should make full use of the potential that is already available to you through your role in solving this thorny issue, in which the EU is directly involved.
Undeclared work deprives workers of social protection and deprives society of social security contributions.
Unfortunately, I would say that the Europe 2020 strategy's ambitions are not visibly in harmony with the reality of budget restrictions, which have substantially cut funding for the main EU programmes in the area of education. I welcome the measures adopted by the Commission aimed at facilitating accessibility, transparency and comparability for the purposes of the recognition process within and among education systems.
Unfortunately, the answer is no, but an increasing number of targeted programmes have been set up to improve the situation, including, for instance, the Danube strategy.
Until now, it has seemed as if European contract law was something unnecessary and the general principle applies that if a provision is not necessary, then it should be omitted. I also believe that this report is a diversionary tactic, designed to draw attention away from the fact that something far more important, namely, EU-wide consumer protection, is still in need of improvement.
Vocational education and training should create the conditions conducive to labour mobility, both during initial studies and as part of the lifelong learning process.
We agree, in this vein, with the importance of more widespread information for investors and that market participants should only be authorised to invest in derivative financial instruments if they can prove to have an understanding and ability to assess the credit risk that the product carries.
We also believe, particularly in view of the current economic situation, that Parliament must review its expenditure and identify savings and ways to increase efficiency.
We also need to promote the 25% reduction of administrative burden indicated in the SBA, which would contribute to the effectiveness of the SBA, would counteract any protectionist economic policies of Member States and stimulate business across the EU. Member States must swiftly implement the revised Late Payments Directive to effectively combat late payments and their negative impact, particularly on SMEs.
We are all concerned about the effects of climate change, environmental conservation and various issues relating to health and social well-being, which are inseparable from the rational use of transport. I agree that applying the 'polluter pays' principle, as well as trying to safeguard the public interest, results, and must result, in measures primarily aimed at reducing environmental pollution, noise pollution, damage to the countryside, and social costs that arise due to poor health, because these generate substantial economic costs that are borne by the public at large, and thus by Europe's citizens.
We are being given by our interpreters the choice to vote 'no' after you have said 'Εγκρίνεται' ['Adopted']. I am not aware that the ability to speak Greek is required of MEPs.
We are faced, however, with ageing power plants and the practice of subcontracting. 80% of those who work in the nuclear industry are subcontractors.
We are not just asking you for de minimis measures, Commissioner Damanaki: we ask that you look into opening up the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), and that you allow it to become more flexible, because of the inability - which you have acknowledged - of some Member States to contribute money and solve the problem.
We are relying on the fact that progress will be made by other governments throughout the world during other global conferences and also after the elections in the US in the late autumn of this year.
We are well aware that the long-term consequences of the catastrophe are still being experienced a full quarter century later.
We believe that the amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade constitute a basis for finding such a solution.
We can also remember how well representation of the Union worked in the World Trade Organisation or in the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
We cannot allow ourselves, the European Union, to be left behind in discord and indecision.
We condemn the illegal exploitation of the mineral resources as well as the pillaging of precious wood, particularly rosewood.
We do not believe that the own resources ceiling should be revised as it should be possible to finance EU policy within the current income ceiling.
We face unfair competition from an increasing number of foreign trucks taking up more than their fair share of cross-border haulage.
We have already hosted a meeting of senior officials from around the world and from the big financial institutions to discuss what we might be able to contribute if asked, and will, but in consultation with our neighbourhood, we have to do more to support resources coming together more effectively.
We have constantly criticised the Council for not progressing that agenda on the basis of the Commission's comprehensive proposal.
We have liberty, but we do not have equality, and without equality there can be no fraternity.
We have seen that we have convergent views on many subjects.
We have to give the people of Europe peace of mind by ensuring that this subject is managed with the utmost transparency and above all, I stress, the utmost safety.
We in Parliament must, therefore, do everything we can to make the International Year of Chemistry a success because, as Marie Curie said, 'now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less'. Celebrating this year is a good time to take that on board.
We know with just as much certainty that it will be the European textile sector that mainly, if not exclusively, pays the price for this humanitarian aid.
We must approach this debate without extolling virtues - Baroness Ashton has rightly highlighted some positive elements; I would emphasise the good or, rather, the better provision of information between Parliament and the European External Action Service - yet also without concealing defects, and a voice as sensible as that of Giorgio Napolitano, our former fellow Member and President of the Italian Republic, has reminded us of this recently.
We must ensure that through our young people, these identities are truly European and not allow the only educational model for our young people in the future to be the American one, although this has, of course, been an important point of reference until now.
We must not confuse bureaucracy with transparency, because not every entry registered on a piece of paper or every approval recorded in a file contributes to making cohesion projects transparent.
We must still make sure that we have the resources to implement this protection and information in all the Member States and to take action against offenders.
We need a democratic regime there and we at the European Union must do our best to establish that because, without that, progress cannot be made.
We need the closest possible harmonisation between the Member States so that, ultimately, we have a harmonised, modern policy which is up to the job, as the times demand.
We need to find viable solutions for the public finances of Athens, Dublin and Lisbon.
We need to rebuild the trust in, and value of, this tool and reserve it for only the most serious of crimes, whilst guaranteeing and maintaining the highest of standards in its use.
We now have an opportunity to work with a broader perspective.
We regret, however, that the registration of organisations has not been made compulsory, especially as it is a de facto obligation to register in order to receive a card to enter our premises.
We should encourage governments that as well as increasing budgetary means allocated each year to research, they should establish a percentage of their budget as a minimum threshold which must be used on research and development-type projects.
We should therefore hold agencies accountable for the effectiveness of their work, but we should remember that the results of this work may now have an incredible impact on the labour market, by linking all vocational training to jobs and professions which are already showing signs of being in short supply in the future European Union.
We therefore chose to support paragraph 5, which calls for greater transparency with regard to Members' expenditure allowance.
We think this is very important because one of the things I consider essential in relation to innovation is that we should have a 'living document': in other words, that we will have the opportunity on a regular basis - in Parliament, internationally at the Innovation Convention, and also at Heads of State or Government level - to monitor progress and to insist, where the progress is slow, on speeding it up. That is very important if this initiative is going to be successful, to create the kind of jobs we want and to deliver what we expect it to deliver at the end of the day.
We want to have genuine own resources, as described in the Treaty.
We will continue to fight for a better economic package.
We wish to say specifically to Mrs Liotard that, as regards the internal Council document you quoted, the Member States were aware of it and naturally the Council was aware of it, and even discussed it. It helped in establishing our position.
We, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have the courage to push through such a set of rules.
What action does the Commission plan to take in order to include the subject of gender equality in European climate change policy?
What is advancing faster than anticipated last year is the creation of the European Emergency Response Centre. I can assure you it would make a big difference because it would allow us to accelerate work on scenario planning - what kinds of disasters we have to be prepared for, and also on modelisation of the committed Member States' assets.
What is the situation when it comes to the judicial reform and anti-corruption measures that are still needed? Those citizens of Romania and Bulgaria who travel to Schengen countries with good intentions will, in any case - and I am convinced of this - understand that the inconvenience of border controls is outweighed by the necessity of protecting all other Europeans against organised crime and mass illegal immigration.
What underlies these reasons? Objective fears or prejudice, situational prudence or disappointment? I hope that the interior and justice ministers will be at least just as frank with each other as we have been during the process of drafting the Coelho report.
Whatever people in this Chamber, or anyone else in the European Union, think about our common foreign and security policy, this is the most outstanding objective endorsement of the ambition that you and we have for the Lisbon Treaty, a foreign policy that has real trust and respect from our foreign partners.
When it comes to food, we need transparency and clear traceability with regard to manufacture.
When there is talk of increases, then discussions must lead to a consideration of the correct use of resources.
Where necessary, we can make recommendations in this area, if we need to be more specific later in the process.
While acknowledging the due responsibility shown by the Commission in the allocations planned for 2012, in my capacity as rapporteur on the budget for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I regret the minimal increase in programmes such as PROGRESS, which is responsible for implementing important initiatives for young people, for the fight against poverty and for gender equality, and the Daphne Programme, which is responsible for policies for combating violence against women.
While the intention of the rapporteur and her political group was to make it stand out from the other five, the fact is that it is very revealing of the contradictions that exist in this European Union.
Whilst there is now nothing to prevent us from enlarging the Schengen area, it is worth noting the recommendations that have been made to these two countries. I hope these recommendations will be strictly monitored, especially as regards the borders between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey, because as you know, mutual trust between the Schengen States relies on countries adhering fully to their reciprocal obligations.
Why, then, should he be trusted this time? That is why the EU and the international community must intervene in the situation, and this illegal government headed by Rajoelina should be brought to an end.
With each enlargement of the Schengen area, we are expanding the area of ​​freedom, security and justice and I am confident that, as in the past, time will show possibilities for economic and other development.
With regard to the debt issue, work is under way as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
With the adoption of today's resolution, the European Parliament has once again called for protection for small and medium-sized enterprises.
With this resolution, the European Parliament intends to express its support for the initiative of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers.
Within this framework, I welcome the rapporteur's proposal for a special plan to be prepared as soon as Bulgaria joins the Schengen area, containing actions in this direction and a joint approach between Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, so that it is in a position to cope with what may be a large increase in immigration flows.
Worse still, in order to escape 'blackmail' by Member States, which are naturally reluctant to increase their already very high contributions, Parliament once more raises the issue of own resources for the EU, or, in short, a European tax. 'Do as I say and not as I do' could be the new European motto.
Yesterday, like today, there is only one true intention: to obtain trade concessions that benefit, above all, the big European importers.
YoM looks to improve higher level education within Europe and to improve student and worker mobility through existing European programmes.
You have already had the chance to state your views, Mr Gollnisch.
You said, 'This is not a permanent solution, we will always have access to the waste'. I approve.
Youth on the Move seeks to increase opportunities for educational mobility for all Europe's young people by 2020, enabling them to progress more smoothly from education to the world of work, by giving them an education that prepares them for the demands of the market.
first and foremost, a strong, fair and well-financed CAP;

Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her.”
He said, “No, but you did laugh.”
Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.
They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.
Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.
“Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God amongst us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”
The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.
Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’
Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,
Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”
He built an altar there, and called on the LORD’s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well.
He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”
He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”
Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.”
Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.
She said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?”
but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel : for, he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”
Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.
They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel.
Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.

These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, “Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.”
The LORD spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, “This is what the LORD says, ‘Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to the LORD.
Pray to the LORD; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.”

You shall put all of this in Aaron’s hands, and in his sons’ hands, and shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.
When Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.
Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall be cut off from his people.”
Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.
