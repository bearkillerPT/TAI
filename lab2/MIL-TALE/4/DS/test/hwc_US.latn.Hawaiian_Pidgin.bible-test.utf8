Dass wat da Boss say.

You stay tell us some stuff we no can figga, an we like know wat dat mean.”
Paul wen start fo talk, but Governa Gallio wen tell da Jews, “If you Jewish guys wen squawk bout someting dat stay wrong o some crime, den dass good fo me fo listen to you guys.
Had one a da Jewish main priest ohana guys name Sceva dat get seven boys. Dey wen make lidat.
He wen stay ova dea three months. He stay ready fo sail Syria side, but da Jewish guys wen make plan fo kill him, so he wen go back thru Macedonia.

Plenny times I wen go from one Jewish church to da odda fo punish um, an I wen try fo make um talk stink agains God. I wen come plenny huhu wit dem, an I even wen go da towns far away fo make um suffa.
We wen lose plenny time, an da Spesho Day Fo Pray An No Eat wen come awready. Da ocean wen stay too rough fo sail dat time. So Paul wen tell um,
Wen da sun wen come up, dey neva know da land wea dey was. But dey wen spock one bay an one sandy beach. Dey wen tink stay mo betta fo make da boat eat it ova dea.

I really like stay by you guys, cuz I like share da good kine stuff from Godʼs Spirit wit you guys. Den you can stay mo strong an mo solid inside.
How you make, same ting, God goin give you back.
No matta dey say dat he do wrong,
Dey no mo respeck fo God notting.”
A da bad kine stuff da guy wen do.”
Befo time, wen still yet neva have da Rules from God, all ova da world had peopo dat was doing bad kine stuff. But wen neva have da Rules, nobody wen go write down wat da bad kine stuff peopo do.
Wat good kine ting you guys wen get from all dat stuff you wen do? Notting! Now you guys get plenny shame weneva you guys tink bout um. Cuz wen you do dat kine stuff, you ony cut yoaself off from God.
Even if we do wat da Rules from God say, dat no can throw out da bad kine stuff inside us, cuz da way us guys stay, we not strong inside. But den God, he wen go send his own Boy fo come one guy jalike us. Da way Jesus wen stay, God wen make him look jalike one regula guy dat can do bad kine stuff, jalike all da odda peopo. But den, Jesus neva do bad kine stuff -- how he wen live, he wen show proof dat da tings da peopo was doing was bad fo shua. Plus, he wen come one sacrifice fo hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff dat all da odda peopo wen do.
An den, who goin poin finga da peopo God wen pick? No mo nobody fo do dat! Cuz God, he da One dat say dat his peopo get um right wit him awready.
Eh, who you tink you? How come you talk back lidat to God, brudda? Jalike da Bible wen tell: “If get one guy dat making one ting, da ting no can tell da guy, ‘Eh! How come you wen make me lidis?’ ”
So den, wat? Wat we goin say? Get all kine peopos from diffren place dat not Jews, dey neva was trying fo get um right wit God befo time. Now, dey get um right wit him, cuz dey stay trus um.
“All ova da world, get peopo dat wen hear da Good Stuff.
Fo shua, he like give um chance, an dass why he wen pick um. No was cuz dey wen go do someting good, an dass why he gotta pick um, you know. If he gotta pick um cuz a da good tings dey wen do, den he no give um chance fo real kine, an he gotta pick um, az why.
“Goin get one guy dat goin take us outa da bad kine stuff,
An he goin stay da greates foeva! Az right!
Dat mean, if get somebody dat go agains da kine peopo dat get dat kine power, az jalike dey going agains da way how God wen go make one govermen fo us. If get anybody dat make lidat, dey goin get it from God da Judge.
Dat dey know I dea Boss, cuz I stay God.’ ”
Anodda place inside da Bible David say dis:
Eh, bruddas an sistas, I aks you guys fo pray hard wit me dat God goin help me. You guys pray cuz Jesus Christ yoa Boss, an cuz Godʼs Spirit give you guys love an aloha.
He da ony God dat stay, an he know everyting. I like everybody tell how awesome he stay foeva, cuz a wat Jesus Christ wen do! Dass it!
Cuz no matta da peopo tink God stupid, he still mo smart den dem. No matta dey tink God not strong, he still mo strong den dem.
O who can teach God wat he suppose to do?
Me an Apollos an Peter, we stay fo you guys! An da whole world stay fo you guys, no matta you alive o mahke! Everyting dat stay happening right now, an everyting dat goin happen lata -- everyting stay fo you guys!
Us guys, we jalike da Bread Dat No Mo Yeast Inside, dat da Jewish peopo make fo eat Passova time. So us guys gotta watch out dat we no do da bad kine stuff, o hurt da odda peopo. We wen make lidat befo time. Mo betta tell da trut everytime, so everybody can see dat we do everyting wit good heart.
No hold back from each odda. You can fo short time, but ony if da husban an da wife tell each odda dey goin hold back fo get time fo pray. An den come back togedda, so da Devil no can make you guys presha make you fool aroun behind da oddaʼs back. But if you no come back togedda fast, you no goin be strong nuff fo say “No!” to da Devil.
I telling you guys dis stuff, cuz good fo you guys. I no like jam up you guys. I like you guys do da right ting, an know wat da Boss like you fo do an be ready fo do um, an no worry bout odda kine stuffs.
You no tink me an Barnabas get da right fo get stuff fo eat an drink from da peopo we teach?
All dat stuff wen happen fo show us guys dat we not suppose to go all out fo do da bad kine stuff, jalike all da peopo dea.
I get someting I like tell you folks -- you all good guys, cuz you guys tink bout me all da time, no matta wat. All da stuff I wen teach you guys, you guys still yet stay do um. Right on!
Wen da Boss punish us guys, you know, he do dat fo teach us guys da right way. He no like us get punish an wipe out wit all da peopo inside da world, bumbye.
If one part a da body suffa, all da odda parts suffa, same time. If one part a da body stay awesome, all da odda parts feel good, same time.
But if I donno wat dea language mean, da peopo dat stay talking lidat, I goin know dat dey not from my peopo, an dey goin know dat I not from dea peopo.
Wot! If you guys no like, try tink bout dis: Who was da guys dat wen start fo tell wat God say, first time? Was you guys? Nah! O you guys tink you da ony peopo dat eva hear wat God say? Get real!
Da Bible wen say befo time, “God make his Spesho Guy be da boss ova everyting.” But you know, wen he say “everyting get him fo boss” -- fo shua, he not talking bout God, da One dat wen make him be da boss ova everyting.
an
“Marana Tha!” You know wat dat mean, Aramaic language? “Eh, Boss! Come back!”
Az why I wen write befo dat I not going yet, so dat you guys can make everyting right, an den wen I go ova dea, I no goin feel all sad cuz a you guys dat suppose to make me feel good inside. I know all you guys, so I know dat wen I stay good inside, den you guys goin stay good inside, jalike me.
But weneva somebody start fo trus da Boss, Christ help um undastan inside dea hearts. Jalike da Bible wen tell bout Moses, “He take away da ting dat cover his face.”
You know, we all gotta go in front Christ da Judge, an no can hide notting. Dat time we goin get back wat we wen do wen we wen stay inside dis world, da good kine stuff o da no good kine stuff.
I goin be dea God
Dey wen beg us plenny fo let um help give money fo kokua da peopo dat stay spesho fo God, Jerusalem side.
But I tell you guys dis: “Da guy who plant litto bit seed, he goin get one small crop. Da guy dat plant plenny seed wit good heart, he goin get mo plenny crop, an he goin stay good inside.”
You know, da Bible say, “Da guy who talk big, let um talk big bout God da Boss.”
An dis too: every day I feel da presha fo tink hard bout all da bruddas an sistas dat come togedda fo God all ova da place.
Christ neva have power wen dey wen kill him on top da cross. An us guys neva have power jalike Christ get power. But God wen give Christ da power fo live now, an he wen give us da power fo live too wit Christ an work fo you guys.
Den I wen go Syria an Cilicia side.
Jalike Abraham. He wen trus God. Az why God wen say Abraham get um right wit him.
Dass why you guys not jalike slaves no moa dat gotta do wat da Rules say. Now you guys Godʼs kids! An God goin give you guys everyting he goin give his kids.
Wat da Bible say? “Throw out da slave wahine an her boy, cuz her boy no goin get da good stuff da fadda like give his wifeʼs boy.”
If one guy tink he hot stuff wen he not, dat guy, he ony bulai himself.
Wen we stay tight wit Godʼs Spirit, dass da first proof fo show us all da good kine stuff God goin give his kids. Bumbye God goin cut loose his kids from all da power dat da bad kine stuff get ova dem, an den everybody goin tell how awesome he stay.
Da whole house line up real good cuz a Christ. An dat house coming one temple dat stay spesho fo da Good Boss.
Dey stay tight wit ony one Guy.
An no let da Devil get one chance fo jam you guys up.
Dat mean, you wifes, listen to yoa own husbans, jalike you listen to da Boss.
Try pray fo me too, so wen I tell da Good Kine Stuff From God, I tell um da right way an I no scared. You know, nobody wen undastan dat stuff befo time, cuz was secret.
But if I stay hea inside da world, dat goin be mo betta fo you guys.

Dey tell, “Fo be Godʼs guy fo real kine, gotta cut skin.” But you know, us guys, we da guys dat get Godʼs Spirit. Dass jalike da mark fo show dat we Godʼs guys fo real kine, not dem. Cuz wen we do stuff fo God, da Spirit help us do um, dass why. Us guys can feel real proud cuz we stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Guy, Jesus Christ. We no tink we okay jus cuz somebody wen do someting to our body.
I no say dis cuz I need someting. I wen learn dat I get nuff stuff awready. I stay good inside no matta wat happen.
Inside da sky an inside da world,
Watch out! No let nobody hemo you guys from da trut! Dey goin try teach you guys wrong kine stuff wit any kine talk. Dey get all dis kine teaching ony from peopo, from now an from befo time, an from da spirits dat stay in charge a da world, but dey neva get um from Christ.
Let Christ take charge a you guys an make yoa hearts rest inside. He wen tell all you guys fo come togedda an stay togedda jalike one ohana. An tank God everytime fo everyting.
Every time us guys go pray, we talk to God bout all you guys, an we say, “Mahalo plenny, God, fo da church peopo Tessalonika side!”
An we wen send Timoty so you guys no presha out wen peopo make you suffa. Cuz you guys know awready dat God let dat kine stuff happen to all us guys.
Cuz you guys know awready dat da time wen da Boss goin come back, goin be jalike wen one steala guy go sneak inside yoa house nite time, an you no expeck.
Eh bruddas an sistas, we jus gotta tell God “Mahalo plenny!” everytime cuz a you guys. Az right we do dat, cuz you guys stay trus God plenny mo an moa, an cuz you guys stay showing mo an mo love an aloha fo each odda.
But da Boss, we can trus him. He goin make you guys come mo strong an solid inside, an no goin let anybody hurt you.
Da stuff I telling you now stay true, an you can trus um: Godʼs Spesho Guy Jesus wen come hea inside dis world, fo take peopo outa da bad kine stuff dey doing. I da one wen do mo plenny bad kine stuff den all da odda peopo.
Da main leada guy gotta do everyting da right way, so nobody can poin finga. He ony can have one wife. He no drink plenny cuz he gotta stay in charge a himself. He tink befo he do tings. He akamai an he do tings good. Peopo from odda place can come his house fo stay litto wile. He teach da peopo real good.
Stay away from da lolo kine stories an da kine stories dat no mo respeck notting fo God. Mo betta, do da kine tings God like everytime.
In front God, Jesus Christ, an da angel guys God wen pick, I tell you dis: Do all dis tings. No ony make some peopo do um an same time let odda peopo no do um.
He get all da power foeva! Az it!
Dat say he goin make our body diffren kine
He no goin ack like he not God.”
An you know wat? Everybody dat like live da way God like, an stay tight wit Godʼs Spesho Guy Jesus Christ, peopo goin make dem suffa.
Jesus wen send me fo help all da guys God wen pick fo trus him. An anodda ting -- he send me fo help dem know fo shua da trut bout da way we suppose to be wen we come close to God.
How come us guys gotta make lidat? Cuz God wen show everybody he get good heart fo help dem, an dass why he can take everybody outa da bad kine stuff dey stay doing.
But I ony one old man name Paul, in jail cuz I stay tight wit Christ, so I like you try do someting cuz you get plenny love an aloha fo me.
Dass da spesho place fo show how importan he stay.
You wen make da earth an da sky,
An you show us plenny respeck
But Christ, he da Faddaʼs Boy, an cuz a dat, he stay in charge a Godʼs peopo. An you know, us guys Godʼs peopo. If we hang in dea, an no mo shame fo come tight wit God, we everytime goin talk bout da good kine stuffs we stay waiting fo God fo do bumbye.
Who da peopo he talking bout dat wen go agains Moses, afta dey wen hear wat he say? Az was all da peopo dat Moses wen bring outa Egypt.
You know, dat head priest guy, he get plenny respeck. But nobody can make himself da head priest guy, cuz dass one spesho job. God gotta be da One fo pick da guy, jalike da first time, he wen pick Aaron.
Wen peopo make one strong promise, dey make um by somebody mo big den dem, so den everybody know dat dey goin do um. Dat show dey really mean um. An den wen dass all pau, da odda peopo no can make argue.
An cuz God wen make one strong promise to Jesus lidat, garans Jesus da One dat goin make shua us guys goin get one mo betta deal.
I goin write um inside dea heart.
Same ting, az why da first deal God wen make befo time, dat deal wen need blood from one animal sacrifice fo make da deal good.
Wen Christ talk lidat, he talking bout da stuff da peopo doing cuz da Rules say dey suppose to do um.
I goin punish um fo real kine.”
All dose peopo, dey wen trus God all da time till dey mahke. No matta dey neva get da stuff God wen promise, dey know dat dey goin get um bumbye. Dey stay good inside, jalike dey see um awready from one far place. An dose peopo tell dat dey not from dis world. Dey ony staying short time ova hea.
Da whole time us guys running da race, we ony stay looking at one guy, dass Jesus. He da One dat wen help us start trussing God, an he help us trus God all da way. Wen he wen suffa on top da cross, he wen hang in dea, an neva bodda him dat dey wen make him shame. He do dat cuz he know dat bumbye he goin stay real good inside. An in da end, he sit down in da mos importan place, by Godʼs throne, on da right side.
Dat time was Godʼs voice dat wen make da earth shake. But now, he wen make promise. He say, “One mo time I goin make da earth shake, an I goin make da sky shake too.”
I like you guys know dis: our brudda Timoty, he outa jail awready! If he come hea quick, den he goin go wit me fo see you guys.
Wat if get two guys dat come to yoa church meeting. One guy get one gold ring, an he all dress up. An da odda guy poor, an ony get puka kine clotheses.
Same ting wit yoa mout. Az ony one small ting, but still yet, can talk real big.
My bruddas an sistas, no talk stink bout each odda. If one guy talk stink bout one brudda, an make himself jalike one judge fo his brudda, dass mean same time he stay tell dat da Rules from God no stay good, cuz dey say he no can judge his brudda. He tink he da judge so he can say dat da Rules no good. If you say da Rules no good, den you no goin do wat da Rules say. You ack jalike you know how fo make one mo betta Rule den God make, but you donno how.
God da Fadda wen pick you guys fo be his guys, cuz he wen know you guys way befo you guys was born. Godʼs Spirit wen make you guys spesho fo him, so you guys can do everyting Jesus Christ tell you guys fo do. Jesus wen mahke fo you guys. Wen you guys do everyting Jesus tell you fo do, dass jalike God sprinkle Jesus blood on top you guys fo show dat you guys stay spesho fo him.
Dat goin go on foeva.”

But you can stay good inside, cuz you suffa togedda wit Christ. Den bumbye you goin come plenny good inside wen everybody see how awesome he stay.
I like you guys know God an Jesus our Boss mo betta, so den, dey goin do plenny good stuff fo you guys, an make yoa hearts rest inside.
Da angel guys, dey mo strong den dem teacha guys. No matta da angel guys get mo plenny power, dey no talk stink bout da awesome guys in front da Boss, an dey no poin finga dem.
From da time everyting had start, had one Guy, “Godʼs Talk,” dass who him. He da One dat can make da peopo come alive inside fo real. You know, me an da odda guys dat was wit Jesus, we wen hear him, see him wit our own eyes, look at him real good, an touch him wit our hands.
